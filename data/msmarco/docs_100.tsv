D2185715	What Is an Appropriate Gift for a Bris 	 Hub Pages   Religion and Philosophy   Judaism What Is an Appropriate Gift for a Bris Updated on April 16  2016Brainy Bunny more Brainy Bunny is married to a Conservative rabbi and has extensive experience with living an observant Jewish life  Contact Author A mohel  ritual circumciser  hard at work on an eight day old Jewish baby boy  not shown     Source Before you can decide whether to buy a gift  you need to know what a bris is  Bris  or brit milah   pronounced BREET mee LAH   is the name for the circumcision ceremony that is performed on an eight day old Jewish boy  The ceremony has three parts the milah   circumcision  the baby s naming and a seudat mitzvah   celebratory meal   The circumcision itself takes less than five minutes  blessings and the speeches during the naming add a little more time  but you can expect the action to conclude within twenty minutes or so  Then  as with so many Jewish customs  it s time to eat and celebrate with the family  Will the family send out formal invitations to the bris Because a bris happens so soon after the baby is born  do not expect a formal invitation  you may get a phone call or an email with the details  or you may hear about it through word of mouth  A bris usually takes place at the family s home  but can also be held in a synagogue  The traditional time of day for a bris is in the morning  and the meal served is usually breakfast or brunch  If you are family or friends with the new parents  you should be there to help celebrate this joyous lifecycle event  A pile of presents at a bris  brit milah   Because traditional Jews do not have baby showers  the mom s friends made a diaper cake for this occasion  instead   Source Should you bring a gift to a bris Yes  Most Jewish couples do not have baby showers  because it is customary to wait until after a baby is actually born to bring any baby related things into the house  Therefore  a bris is usually the first good opportunity to bring a gift for the newborn  unless you are close enough to the family to have visited in the hospital  If you aren t close to the family at but will be attending the bris anyway  it is definitely polite to bring a gift  but it doesn t have to be large or expensive  One exception to this rule is if the bris is being held on Shabbat in the synagogue  In that case  you should not bring gifts with you  as carrying is not allowed on the Sabbath  The best course of action is then to visit the family at home sometime during the baby s first month to give your gift  if you can   If you just happen to be at the synagogue for services and are not a guest of the family  you do not need to give a gift   If the family is religiously observant but you are not  and you cannot think of another way to get your present to them  ask a synagogue administrator if there s a secure place you can leave your gift for the family to pick up after Shabbat ends  Jewish Holiday Quiet Book for Children By Pockets of Learning   PERSONALIZEDThis soft busy book will introduce baby to the Jewish holidays  Buy Now What kind of gift should you bring to a bris  brit milah  You do not have to bring a Jewish gift  Any gift that you might bring to a baby shower is appropriate for a bris  That means you can take a look at the family s baby registry if they have one  and get them something they actually need   I had a friend buy me a Diaper Genie for my son s bris  and it was one of the best presents ever   Other practical gifts for newborns include clothing  not just in newborn size  some babies grow fast    toys  and books to read to the baby  If you want to bring a Jewish gift  consider Jewish themed wall décor or novelty onesies with Jewish phrases  Jewish children s books are another good choice  because the parents will be able to read them to their son for many years  Ritual items such as kiddush cups don t make very good bris gifts  because the baby won t be able to use them for many years  Note  Try to include gift receipts for whatever you buy  because babies grow at different rates and have different needs  and a gift receipt will allow the new parents to exchange some of the onesies they receive for waterproof mattress pads or hospital type pacifiers or whatever odd thing they actually need  How much should you spend on a gift for a bris Let your relationship to the new family and the circumstances of your wallet be your guides  A coworker might bring a cute outfit or two  and no one will notice if he got it on sale   while the mom s best friend from college might put together a whole basket of baby goodies including toys  books  clothes  and feeding accessories  A well off friend of the family might give a less personal but generous present such as a large gift card to spend on diapers  while an underemployed friend might decide to crochet a baby blanket by hand to make a special gift  Good wishes and thoughtfulness go a long way toward making any present special  Florene Jewish Theme   Baby With Yarmulke   Coffee Gift Baskets   Coffee Gift Basket  cgb_16775_1 How about a coffee gift basket to help the sleepless

parents will already have the medical supplies they need to take care of the baby s incision while it heals  but they probably won t have thought of their own needs  Include some funny items and some useful ones  like A bottle of wine for Mom to calm her down before the procedure A bottle of Scotch for Dad afterwards to stop his hands from shaking A book about brit milah for an older sibling of

Baby with Gastro esophageal Reflux    I have a baby with Gastro esophageal Reflux Disease should I worry that she will have autism  I want to clarify my doubt to be more overcautious  Kindlyguide me Q  how do you deal with a mild case of acid reflux A  You can start with life style changes  if you have symptoms during the night  you can try to elevate the head of your bed  You can try to avoid foods that induce reflux  fatty foods  chocolate peppermint  and excessive alcohol  Cola  red wine  and orange juice are very acidic  so it would be wise to avoid them too  In addition to these  you can try to use a diary to reveal which kind of food causes symptoms and avoid it  Try to refrain from lying down immediately after a meal  or eating just before bedtime  Overweight is a risk factor for reflux  so if it s relevant weight reduction is also recommended  If you feel heartburn  you may chew in order to increase salivation and thus alleviate thesymptoms  Smoking has a negative effect on salivation  so smoking cessation is alsorecommended  And that s before we even mentioned OTC drugs    Q  is there anything to cure G  E  R  D  instead of taking pills daily A  there is no known way to   cure   but it can be manageable  there s a somewhat new procedure An endoscope  Using this scope  doctors can treat the lower part of the esophagus to improvehow it works  These nonsurgical

D3180369	Real Life Fitness Questions Answered	How many calories can I burn in a 45minute tone class Can you please let me know how many calories you can burn in a 45 minute tone class  Thanks Vicky Our expert says    Hi Vicky  A 45minute tone class would approximate to around 240 310 calories in a 45minute class but where in this range you fall will depend on several factors  1  The type of activities that make up the content of the class   the more time dedicated to aerobic style  high intensity movement  i e  boxercise style  dance  step  the higher the potential calorie burning  The percentage of time within the class using a Swiss ball will provide high levels of muscle activity at a moderate intensity and so will increase the calorie expenditure  The amount of time given to yoga or Pilates or stretching will be time spent at a lower intensity and therefore will have a lower demand of calories burned  The above is worth remembering as different exercise instructors will involve different exercise components to a different degree and obviously one tone class could consist of very different movements exercises to another  2  Personal level of fitness   if someone is a beginner to exercise or to the specific workout  generally they could potentially find the workout more demanding and so use up more calories  As we adapt and gain fitness benefits through consistent use  so the calorie demand will drop as we become more efficient at the workout  3  The quality of techniques   it is incredible how different people can do the  same  workout but experience completely different results and this relates to the effort and technique given by the individual  If someone has good technique and can activate the right muscle groups then they will be able to burn up more calories then someone who is cheating themselves on some of the movements   holds  Hope this helps Kelly

Tapas place around  11 16 2016Hi Ladies  Wanted to say Thank you for all your help  We were very happy with everything from planning to the night of the wedding  You were very accommodating and

I did and she will surely know you love her  12 23 2016Julie and Katie  We can t thank you guys enough for everything you did to make our day perfect  We felt confident from the very beginning of planning a year ago and right up to our wedding day  Thanks for answering all of our emails and putting up with my millions of questions  We were so happy with how everything went  Thanks also for coming back to celebrate with us at the end of the night  It was so fun to see you guys    12 31 2016We celebrated my birthday on Jan 6  However  I don t need a special occasion to go to Mesón Sabika  I just love it  My family loves it  and now  my extended family loves it  The food is diverse and delicious  meeting all types of people s taste palettes  The setting is marvelous and statuesque  and right in our hometown of Naperville  Thank you   1 6 2017It is so gracious of you to offer teachers 40  off their dining experiences in Districts  203 and  204  This makes it possible to enjoy every minute of the visit  Thank you for valuing teachers  their passions  responsibilities and jobs  1 7 2017We got married in the pavilion of Mesón Sabika one week ago today  I wanted a unique venue that wasn t just a banquet room of a hotel  The pavilion at Mesón Sabika was the perfect location  The glass windows on three sides were perfect and because of the date  12 31  there were still white lights outside in the trees  making for the perfect ambiance  As soon as we got engaged  on 12 31 15  I started looking for unique venues that were available on 12 31 16 since I knew I wanted to get married on New Year s Eve  When we went to visit the venue on 1 9 16  we booked on the spot  Not only is it more reasonably priced than anywhere else in the Chicagoland area  but we knew after meeting with Julie that day  that she was someone we could spend the next year planning with  Like all other reviews have said  Julie and Katie respond extremely promptly to every email sent  Sometimes within minutes and even on the weekends  I felt like I asked a million questions and every single time  they answered pleasantly and promptly  We met with Julie a few weeks before the wedding to talk through details and we felt that she was extremely thorough and on top of everything  We had hired a day of coordinator and the day of the wedding  everything went so smoothly we never even had to worry about a thing  The head banquet person had met with Julie and was aware of all of the specific things about our day  We were able to change our head count even a few days before the wedding when an additional guest was added  The food was awesome and we had so many compliments since it was not your typical chicken or beef meal that you usually get at a wedding  We chose the tapas menu  but added and substituted a few things without a problem  The banquet staff was fabulous and kind to us and all of our guests  It was the perfect place to have a wedding and the perfect place to ring in the new year  We appreciate everything that every employee did to make our day perfect  Megan 1 7 2017There is a reason why Mesón Sabika is one of the most popular venues in the area  We had our wedding reception in the Pavilion  and it was absolutely perfect  We worked with Katie and she was a constant help throughout the entire process  I don t think I can say anything that hasn t already been said by other reviewers  The food was delicious  the room was beautiful  the staff was professional and courteous  the vendors love working with Katie and Julie  etc   etc  Mike 1 28 2017My family and I have dined at Mesón Sabika for over thirty years when it had a different owner  Still the quality of the dining is outstanding and you will never find more interesting sauces and menu items anywhere  The atmosphere is amazing and takes you back to an era gone by  In the summertime  dining outside under the stars transports you to another location  like you re on vacation but you re not  My favorite place to dine  Consistently wonderful  2 10 2017I want to take a moment and thank you and the staff at Mesón Sabika for making our wedding day so special  As you know we had several guests from out of town  including our family and closest friends  and without exception  everyone raved about their experience  The quality of the hors d oeuvres  appetizers  entrees  dessert and drinks  the decor  atmosphere  service  cleanliness  and location all contributed to a perfect evening  I was especially appreciative of the staff  for regardless of my requests  including some significant changes in the reception room layout and the  chapel   the only response I ever received was a desire to accommodate my request and make me completely happy  I am not sure I have ever experienced such a considerate and professional staff  Thank you so much for your own personal helpfulness  flexibility  and attentiveness though out the process as well  You were sensational  We were told by others how great of a job your restaurant would do  and to our great joy we experienced it first hand  Please pass along our appreciation to your staff  and know that Mesón Sabika will forever be part of our happiest memories  Karen   Tim 2 21 2017Hello Julie We had a wonderful time  Everything was perfect  The service was impeccable  We thank you and staff for making our  day  a great experience  We ll be sure to stop in for dinner next time we are in town  Warm regards Silvio and Raquel3 18 2017I had been wanting to do brunch for quite sometime but never got the chance  We have been here numerous times for dinner but now that I have had the brunch I think that s the way to go  Everything was AMAZING  3 19 2017We cannot thank you enough for making our day so memorable  Everything was perfect  I will definitely be recommending Mesón Sabika to others to host events  And a big thank you to you since you were the one coordinating our wedding  Lisa and John4 22 2017Mesón Sabika is one of our favorite places to dine in the Naperville area  Their ambiance and outdoor seating cant be beat  Service is always top notch and for vegetarian options  they top the list for new and innovative plates to try for lunch or dinner  Sangria is GREAT and wine selection is fantastic  If you are a meat or fish eater  you will also love this place  Great for date night or large groups  4 25 2017This is my third time at Mesón  I ve tried a variety of the tapas and they are excellent  Since I have celiac disease I ve always ordered the gluten free tapas and they are delicious and I haven t had any cross contamination issues  5 13 2017Hey guys   Just wanted to take a quick minute to say THANK YOU     everyone had an amazing time  the food was perfect and delicious and Katie was an absolute help while I had some minor break downs lol the entire staff went above and beyond   We want to come back next year for our anniversary  Even though it monsooned it was perfect  Hope you guys have a great weekend    Joy   Neil 5 26 2017Julie  I can t say enough how wonderful your staff was yesterday at our wedding  They accommodated our every request and went above and beyond making our day incredible  The owner even stopped by to wish us well   The food was as delicious as always and everyone raved about the ambiance  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts  Lindsey   Brendan 5 27 2017Mesón Sabika was willing to accommodate my every request   from a sweetheart table  to an additional bar for my large wedding party  to providing milk shooters for my late night snack   Oreos  Guests raved about the food as well as the ambiance of the venue  It is breathtaking and I wouldn t have wanted my reception anywhere else 6 2 2017Utterly fantastic every time I go there  I am moving away from Naperville next week and I think Mesón Sabika is the thing I will miss the most  6 10 2017Definitely one of my all time favorite restaurants  Can t beat their outdoor patio and their Tapas and red sangria are the best around  6 10 2017Julie at Méson Sabika was an absolute joy to work with  The process was stress free and they accommodated every need that we had  I didn t have to worry about a thing the day of the wedding  People are still talking about how good the food was and how beautiful the venue is  The gardens in the summer and the mansion make for a beautiful photo backdrop  Highly recommend this venue   7 6 2017Great local spot in Naperville where we got married  Service was particularly good this time  We prefer the outdoor patio in the summer  rather than a table inside  Patatas Aioli  bacon wrapped dates  tuna cannolli are among our favs  Gluten free options and vegetarian available  7 12 2017Thank you so much to you and all of your team for hosting us last Friday  We had a great time and were so impressed with the facilities and food  Thanks for making this such a memorable experience for students  I was really grateful to the wait staff for responding so

D2657999	Caucus	 Caucus From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia  Redirected from Caucuses navigation search This article is about political meetings  For the geographic region  see Caucasus  For the purported ancestor of Caucasians  see Caucas  A caucus is a meeting of supporters or members of a specific political party or movement  The term originated in the United States  but has spread to Australia  Canada  New Zealand  South Africa and Nepal  As the use of the term has been expanded  the exact definition has come to vary among political cultures  Contents   hide  1 Origin of the term2 In alternative dispute resolution3 In the United States3 1 Caucuses to select election candidates3 2 Congressional caucuses4 In Commonwealth nations4 1 Australia  Canada  New Zealand and South Africa4 2 United Kingdom5 In organizations6 See also7 References8 External links Origin of the term    edit Lewis Carroll mocked the futility of caucuses in   A Caucus Race and a Long Tale    Chapter 3 of Alice s Adventures in Wonderland   1865   when the   Caucus race   of running in a circle stops  everyone is declared a winner by the Dodo and Alice is told to hand out prizes to all others  receiving her own thimble as her prize  The origin of the word caucus is debated  but it is generally agreed that it first came into use in the British colonies of North America    1 A February 1763 entry in the diary of John Adams of Braintree  Massachusetts  is one of the earliest appearances of Caucas  already with its modern connotations of a    smoke filled room    where candidates for public election are pre selected in private This day learned that the Caucas Clubb meets at certain Times in the Garret of Tom Daws  the Adjutant of the Boston Regiment  He has a large House  and he has a moveable Partition in his Garrett  which he takes down and the whole Clubb meets in one Room  There they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from one End of the Garrett to the other  There they drink Phlip I suppose  and there they choose a Moderator  who puts Questions to the Vote regularly  and Selectman  Assessors  Collectors  Wardens  Fire Wards  and Representatives are Regularly chosen before they are chosen in the Town      2 An article in Great Leaders and National Issues of 1896  surveying famous presidential campaigns of the past  begins with an unsourced popular etymology of the origin of the caucus    3 The Origin of the   Caucus   The presidential nominating convention is a modern institution  In the early days of the Republic a very different method was pursued in order to place the candidates for the highest office in the land before the people  In the first place  as to the origin of the   caucus    In the early part of the eighteenth century a number of caulkers connected with the shipping business in the North End of Boston held a meeting for consultation  That meeting was the germ of the political caucuses which have formed so prominent a feature of our government ever since its organization  No wholly satisfactory etymology has been documented    4  James Hammond Trumbull suggested to the American Philological Association that it comes from an Algonquian word for   counsel     cau  cau as u   The word might also derive from the Algonquian cawaassough  meaning an advisor  talker  or orator    5  This explanation was favoured by Charles Dudley Warner    6  The American Heritage Dictionary suggests that it possibly derived from medieval Latin caucus  meaning   drinking vessel      7  such as might have been used for the flip drunk at Caucus Club of colonial Boston  An analogical Latin type plural   cauci   is occasionally used    8 In alternative dispute resolution    edit The term caucus is also used in mediation  facilitation and other forms of alternate dispute resolution to describe circumstances wherein  rather than meeting at a common table  the disputants retreat to a more private setting to process information  agree on negotiation strategy  confer privately with counsel and or with the mediator  or simply gain   breathing room   after the often emotionally difficult interactions that can occur in the common area where all parties are present    9  The degree to which caucuses are used can be a key defining element  and often an identifier  of the mediation model being used  For example    facilitative mediation   tends to discourage the use of caucuses and tries to keep the parties talking at a single table  while   evaluative mediation   may allow parties to separate more often and rely on the mediator to shuttle information and offers back and forth    10 In the United States    edit Precincts from Washington State s 46th Legislative District caucus in a school lunchroom  2008   In United States politics and government  caucus has several distinct but related meanings  Members of a political party or subgroup may meet to coordinate members  actions  choose group policy  or nominate candidates for various offices  Caucuses to select election candidates    edit Further information  Iowa caucuses  Texas caucuses  Nevada caucuses  and Colorado Caucus See also  United States presidential primary and United States presidential nominating convention There is no provision for the role of political parties in the United States Constitution  In the first two presidential elections  the Electoral College handled nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 which selected George Washington  After that  Congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party s presidential candidates  Nationally  these caucuses were replaced by the party convention starting in 1832 following the lead of the Anti Masonic Party 1831 convention    11 The term caucus is frequently used to discuss the procedures used by some states to select presidential nominees such as the Iowa caucuses  the first of the modern presidential election cycle  and the Texas caucuses    12  Since 1980 such caucuses have become  in the aggregate  an important component of the nomination process    13 Congressional caucuses    edit Main article  Congressional caucus Another meaning is a sub grouping of officials with shared affinities or ethnicities who convene  often but not always to advocate  agitate  lobby or to vote collectively  on policy  At the highest level  in Congress and many state legislatures  Democratic and Republican members organize themselves into a caucus  occasionally called a   conference       14  There can be smaller caucuses in a legislative body  including those that are multi  partisan or even bicameral  Of the many Congressional caucuses  one of the best known is the Congressional Black Caucus  a group of African American members of Congress  Another prominent example is the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  whose members voice and advance issues affecting Hispanics in the United States  including Puerto Rico  In a different vein  the Congressional Internet Caucus is a bipartisan group of Members who wish to promote the growth and advancement of the Internet  Other congressional caucuses such as the Out of Iraq Caucus  are openly organized tendencies or political factions   within the House Democratic Caucus  in this case   and strive to achieve political goals  similar to a European    platform     but generally organized around a single issue  In Commonwealth nations    edit Australia  Canada  New Zealand and South Africa    edit The term is used in Australia  Canada  New Zealand and South Africa  However  when used in these countries    caucus   is more often a collective term for all members of a party in Parliament  otherwise called a parliamentary group  rather than a word for a regular meeting of these Members of Parliament  Thus  the Australian Federal Parliamentary Labor Party is commonly called   the Labor Caucus       15 The word was used in New Zealand from at least the 1890s  when organized political parties began to emerge  the largest of them  the Liberal Party  used it to refer to its parliamentary members    16  It was introduced to Australia in 1901 by King O Malley  an American born Labour member of the first Federal Parliament  In New Zealand  the term is now used by all political parties    17  but in Australia  it continues to be used only by the Labor Party  For the Australian Liberal  National and Green parties  the usual equivalent term is   party room    In South Africa all parties use the term   caucus      18  In Canada    caucus   refers to all members of a particular party in Parliament  including senators  or a provincial legislature    19    20  These members elect among themselves a caucus chair who presides over their meetings  This person is an important figure when the party is in opposition and an important link between cabinet and the backbench when the party is in government  In a Westminster System  a party caucus can be quite powerful  as it can elect or dismiss the party s parliamentary leader  The caucus also determines some matters of policy  parliamentary tactics  and disciplinary measures against disobedient MPs  In some parties  the caucus also has the power to elect MPs to Cabinet when the party is in government  For example  this is traditionally so in the Australian Labor Party and the New Zealand Labour Party  United Kingdom    edit   The Caucus    1892 caricature of Francis Schnadhorst  Secretary of the UK National Liberal Federation  published in Vanity Fair The term   caucus   is not generally used in contemporary United Kingdom politics  other than as an occasional loose synonym for a political clique or cabal  In the UK and the Republic of Ireland   not a Commonwealth country   the usual term for all members of a party in Parliament is   parliamentary party    However  the word   caucus   did have wide currency in the UK in the late 19th century  in reference to a highly structured system of management and control within a political party  specifically the Liberal Party  Originally a pejorative term  with overtones of corrupt American practices  used by detractors of the system  the name was soon adopted by the Liberals themselves  The system had originated at a local level in Birmingham in preparation for the 1868 general election  when  under the 1867 Reform Act  the city had been allocated three parliamentary seats  but each elector had only two votes  in order to spread votes evenly  the secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association  William Harris   later dubbed the   father of the Caucus    devised a four tier organizational structure  of ward committees  general committee  executive committee  and management committee  through which Liberal voters in different wards could be instructed in the precise combinations in which to cast their votes    21    22  In 1877 the newly formed National Liberal Federation was given a similar structure  on the initiative of Joseph Chamberlain  and again worked out in detail by Harris    23  Shortly afterwards the term   caucus   was applied to this system by The Times newspaper  which referred to   the  caucus  with all its evils    and by the Conservative prime minister  Benjamin Disraeli    24    25    26    27    28  The Liberal Caucus was also vilified by socialists and trade unionists  who  prior to the establishment of the Independent Labour Party  sought a route to parliamentary representation through the Liberal Party via the Labour Representation League and the Labour Electoral Association  but found their way barred by the party s management structures    29  Moisey Ostrogorsky devoted some nine chapters of his Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties   1902  to discussion of the development and operation of the   Caucus   in this sense    30 In organizations    edit In conventions  where the membership from different parts of the organization may gather  each separate group within the organization may meet prior to the convention as a caucus    31  Each caucus may decide how the group would vote on various issues that may come up at the convention    31  Unless the votes are made binding  however  each delegate is still free to vote in any fashion    31 See also    edit Committee Parliamentary group United States presidential election References    edit     Party

D1081736	Candida Albicans	 Candida Albicans Candida Albicans is the formal name for the fungus or yeast that is responsible for yeast infections  Normally it lives in symbiosis in the human body along with a variety of other healthy bacteria  It actually has the important job of helping to detect and destroy other pathogenic bacteria that may enter the body  but sometimes something happens in the body that allows it to grow out of control and it create infections accompanied by a variety of unpleasant symptoms  One of it s other functions is to decompose a dead body and when it proliferates in a living body it still tries to do it s job  It flourishes in environments that are dark  moist and warm and thus the most common places overgrowth occurs is in the mouth  feet  vagina and gastrointestinal tract  However  a yeast infection can actually occur almost anywhere in the body and affect not only women  but men and children as well  Once Candida Albicans sets up house in the gastrointestinal tract  it can change forms and penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the blood stream  which allows it to travel all through the body  It may then take up residence anywhere  like the lungs  joints  muscles  sinuses  brain  spine  gallbladder  liver  or anywhere it pleases  When it permeates the intestinal wall  it leaves microscopic holes  which may lead to the development of leaky gut syndrome and food allergies as undigested food particles and other toxins enter the body  It has a variety of names and is also known as thrush  athletes feet  vaginal yeast infection  Candida  Candida yeast  yeast syndrome or yeast infection  When it enters the blood stream is then called systemic Candida or Candidiasis  The overgrowth of Candida Albicans is rampant in our society due to two main factors  Those factors are the overuse of prescription antibiotics and a diet that is low in nutritional value and high in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates  When you take an antibiotic it kills all the bacteria in your body  the bad and the good  The problem is that your body needs the good bacteria to maintain health and keep opportunistic invaders like Candida from taking over  Antibiotics don t effect Candida  therefore when all the good bacteria are eliminated by antibiotics  the Candida is free to grow rampant and take over  Candida Albicans main source of food is sugar  Any food that you eat that contains sugar  starches or simple carbohydrates will feed the Candida and encourage it to multiply even more  This problem is complicated even more by the fact that poor nutrition means your body is not getting adequate vitamins and minerals to keep your immune system strong and body functioning optimally  This leaves the body more vulnerable to overgrowth of Candida  Other contributing factors to the overgrowth of this fungus are birth control pills  antacids  ulcer medication  cortisone  weak immune system  heavy metals  mercury leaching from mercury dental fillings  steroids  environmental toxins  chlorinated drinking water  inadequate levels of hydrochloric acid and other essential digestive enzymes  synthetic estrogen  a ph level in the body that is too acidic  and immune suppressing drugs  Candida creates and releases over 70 different toxins like ethanol and acetaldehyde into your blood stream that not only cause a host of problems in the human body  but also weaken the immune system  Ethanol is an alcohol and acetaldehyde is related to formaldehyde  These toxins disrupt normal functioning of the bodies systems  It can also interfere and mimic estrogen  thyroxin and other hormones in the body thus creating hormonal imbalances and problems with the thyroid or other glands  These toxins can also overload the liver and impede normal liver functions  Candida Albicans and its toxins can infiltrate and effect any organ or system in the body and can be responsible for a large variety of physical and mental health conditions that we see so commonly in people today  Most people are unaware that it may be the cause of their arthritis  headaches  migraines  anxiety  depression  aggression  mood swings  fatigue  sore throats  gas  bloating  persistent cough  irritable bowel syndrome  hyperactivity  memory problems  attention deficit  cold sores  eczema  hormonal fluctuations  menstrual difficulties  inability to lose weight  Crohns  Prostatitis Autism and much  much more  The overgrowth of Candida yeast is an extremely complex and difficult condition to overcome once it infiltrates the body  It is one of the most obstinate  clever and highly adaptive organisms you will ever encounter  It has the ability to mutate and develop stronger forms of itself  Your best course of action in eliminating yeast overgrowth involves learning about the Candida diet and following it as strictly as possible  eliminating sugar and refined carbohydrates from your diet  avoiding the use of antibiotics or other prescription drugs that may encourage yeast overgrowth and educating yourself as thoroughly as possible about every different aspect of this complicated syndrome  There are a variety of treatment products and approaches available on the market today and many practitioners treating this condition are not fully educated about all the intricate details and aspects  so deciding which route to take can be very confusing  Before embarking on a particular treatment path it is crucial that you have a complete understanding of the depth and complexity of Candida Albicans  You can impede your progress and decrease effectiveness of a product or remedy if you don t have all the facts and understand the most effective way to approach treatment  To get started on the right foot from the get go  you ll find this quick and easy read called   Candida Secrets   to be just what you re looking for
D2845390	 	 New York  2005Dear Viewer Since moving to the United States over forty years ago  I began to speak more like Americans  Words  accents  language have always fascinated me  So it was thrilling twenty years ago to work on a TV series about the English language  In our television series The Story of English we traced the origins of our language and how it spread around the world  That was in the 1980 s  I m curious to see how the language has moved on since then  One thing is clear  American English has become the dominant form of the language  What answers do you get today when you ask   Do you speak American  Sincerely Robert Mac Neil Print Table of Contents Program Description Recommended Uses of Do You Speak American Key Issues Summary   Episode 1Summary   Episode 2Summary   Episode 3Roadmap for Viewing   Episode 1Roadmap for Viewing   Episode 2Roadmap for Viewing   Episode 3Resources Glossary of Terms Program Description In the three part series Do You Speak American   host Robert Mac Neil takes viewers on a journey through the United States  exploring how the language we use can define us  unite us  or separate us  The title highlights a crucial idea raised throughout the documentary  What does it mean to  speak American   To many  the most obvious answer is that speaking American means speaking English  As revealed in the documentary  however  the answer is much more complex  Not all Americans speak English  and those who do speak English do not speak all speak the same version  On the contrary  the English used in the United States differs from region to region  among ethnic and other social groups  and even by age and gender  As Mac Neil discovers  many people shift from one version of English to another depending on the person they are speaking to and where they are  In addition  there are more than 2 million people in the United States who do not speak English at all  To explore the question of what it means to speak American  Mac Neil travels down the Eastern Seaboard from Maine to Philadelphia  where he turns west into Pennsylvania and Ohio  From there  he heads south through Kentucky and Tennessee to Mississippi and into Louisiana and Texas  His journey then takes him to the West Coast and the varieties of English spoken around Los Angeles  The series ends with a look at high tech language research in Palo Alto  California  and offers a glimpse into the future with information about voice and computer technology at Microsoft headquarters in Washington State  At several points along the journey  Mac Neil talks to people about the language they use and what it means in their lives  He has conversations with musicians  politicians  television and radio personalities  journalists  movie producers  surfers  military personnel  and researchers  He also elicits the help of several sociolinguists researchers engaged in the scientific study of language in its social context who provide expert observations on language as a social phenomenon  Viewing language from such a broad perspective reveals that speaking American means different things to different people and that  because of political and social issues surrounding language  there is no consensus on what speaking American is or should be  In fact  as we learn in this series  the United States has no official language  although numerous attempts to implement one have been made throughout the country s history  For some  speaking American means adhering to a single  correct  way of using English that guards against onslaughts on the language from various sources  For many who hold this view  English should be spoken in a way that reflects the way it is written and with pronunciations that sound  neutral   For others  the style of English they speak is a way of identifying with home  peers  or a certain way of life  For these people  it s not a matter of speaking English the  right way  but of speaking in a way that makes them comfortable in their world and that accurately projects their identity  Language standards vary according to the groups that speakers identify with  They also vary from place to place  compare  for example  Standard British English versus Standard American English  Standards also change over time  so it can be quite difficult to determine exactly what  correct English  might be  Do You Speak American  demonstrates that the way we speak is intrinsically tied to a number of complex factors  including ethnicity  political climate  socioeconomic status  historical events  and individual personality  The series offers a rare opportunity for viewers to hear and discuss how language shapes us as individuals  as communities  and as a nation  Back to Top Recommended Uses of Do You Speak American This program will be of interest to all language users  especially to those who have a special stake in language whether personal or professional including teachers  policy makers

our identities through language  The program offers a good basis for discussion in social groups  special interest groups  and book clubs  Ideas for discussion are presented in this guide  Do You

as you watch the program  They can also guide group discussion  Episode 1Robert Mac Neil says   Americans consider themselves egalitarian and un snobbish about accents  but they re full of notions about how not to speak   Do you agree that Americans are opinionated when it comes to language  What might be some examples of this  Has anyone ever instructed you to change your speech  Do you think that person was right to correct you Mac Neil describes English in New York City as  a language that fuels the great publishing empires  From the city that never sleeps 24 7  on TV  cable  radio  electronic media come the words and ideas that define American culture and market it to the world  You can make a case that New York City is now the global capital of the English language   Do you agree  How do you feel about English being used around the globe  For what reasons would people use English rather than another language People who make a living in language related professions are often divided into two camps that Mac Neil refers to as prescriptivists and descriptivists  Language teachers  editors  and other people whose job it is to work with what they consider correct English are likely to take a prescriptivist stance  The linguists and social worker you see in Episode 1 can be considered descriptivists because they are interested in how language is really used rather than prescribing how to use it  New York Magazine theatre critic John Simon and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower show themselves to be on opposite sides of this language debate  How can you tell which of the two is a prescriptivist and which is a descriptivist  In general  are you more of a prescriptivist or a descriptivist  As you continue to view the series  keep this dichotomy in mind and consider which camp each of the people featured falls into  John Simon claims that in his experience  language can always disintegrate further   and  there is no bottom   Do you believe that the English language is disintegrating  If so  what measures would you propose to save English  Do you agree that language can always get worse  What would be the outcome if English continued to disintegrate  What would the language be like then Did you know that the English of 1000 years ago was so different from today s English that we can t read it today without translation  Here s a small sample of what it was like  Pyles   Algeo  1982   On angynne gescēop God heofonan and eorðan  In the beginning  God created heaven and earth  Does this example  from the book of Genesis in the Bible  suggest that English has deteriorated over time Dr  Cutler claims that White male teens  who are sort of afraid of women or young women and are in the process of trying to figure out how it is that one deals with them  are often attracted to  hard core rappers  because these rappers illustrate a type of  masculinity that doesn t perhaps exist in the safe White suburbs   What assumptions about gender identity and gender roles underlie this claim  What is meant by  types of masculinity   Is there more than one type  and  if so  what types are there  What forms of masculinity are available in White suburbs that aren t available to  hard core rappers   Do girls ever engage in dialect crossing as Dr  Cutler describes it  Why or why not  If possible  provide examples of people you know who cross dialects  What is your language heritage  Did you or any of your ancestors learn English as a second language as a result of being in America  If so  what has happened to the other language  s  your family originally spoke Linguist Dennis Preston conducts research about language ideology what people think about different regional varieties of English  In the first episode  he asks people on a train to draw on maps where they think the best and worst American English is spoken  Where do you think good American English is spoken  Where is the worst spoken  Explain  Kirk Arnott  an editor at The Columbus Dispatch  lists several words that he says are often used incorrectly in today s English  for example  nonplussed  importantly  and bemused  Is it important that people like Arnott monitor the use of words  Do you use any of these words yourself  If so  how do you use them There is a popular belief that Americans are sounding more like each other all the time that is  that variations in language are being lost because of the influence of mainstream media  However  Dr  William Labov and others in the series present evidence that certain aspects of language  such as pronunciation  are becoming less similar across different groups  depending on such factors as geographic region  Does this surprise you  If Labov is right  what might be some reasons that the English used in mass media does not seem to have an influence on individual speech Dr  John Baugh does research on what is called language profiling  or how people are judged according to how they speak  Are you surprised that people who speak African American or Chicano English are treated differently than mainstream English speakers over the telephone  Do you think it is possible to tell people s ethnicity and socioeconomic status based only on how they talk Baugh says   It s often assumed by Blacks as well as Whites that African Americans speak bad or lazy English  In fact  Black English has roots as deep and a grammar as consistent as Scottish  Irish  or any other of the Englishes spoken around the world   What is Baugh referring to when he says  roots as deep and a grammar as consistent as       any other of the Englishes  Back to Top Roadmap for Viewing Episode 2Spanky and Cody James both have adopted a Southern style of speaking  although it is not a native speech variety for them  Ranch owner Linda Blackburn has also taken on the local style of speaking since moving to Texas  What might have motivated these people to change the way they talk  Do you know anyone who has done this  or have you done it yourself  Do you ever notice that you speak differently depending on where you are and with whom you are speaking  Listen carefully to the way Dr  Guy Bailey sounds when he speaks with Mac Neil and when he speaks with Willy  What differences do you notice in the way he talks to the two men  Why do you think he changes his speech  and do you think he himself is aware of it Does it seem to you that the English varieties associated with Whites and African Americans in the United States are becoming more different from one another  Do you agree with Mac Neil s statement that  More separate languages mean more separate peoples   To what extent do the multiple varieties of English spoken in America divide groups of people  Do separate languages divide people in America  What about in other countries Newspaper columnist Molly Ivins describes the English used in Texas  What distinctive characteristics does English have in your region  Why do you think people in your region speak the way they do Allan Wall expresses the opinion that people who live in the United States should all speak English  and he believes that English should be made the official language of the United States  Do you think the United States needs to make English its official language  What would this accomplish  Who might benefit from such a policy  What does it mean to have an official language Back to Top Roadmap for Viewing Episode 3The linguist Dr  Carmen Fought says that Chicano English is a distinct speech variety  Many speakers of Chicano English  she says  don t even know Spanish  She expresses the view that Spanish is in danger of disappearing in the United States but that English is not threatened  Compare this point of view to that of Allan Wall  Do you think Latino people in the United States should maintain their Spanish and also learn to speak English  What is the value for people in the United States of speaking more than one language At P  S  100 in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles  students are taught how to translate from their home language into mainstream English  Does this seem to be a good way of teaching mainstream English  Why or why not  Noma Le Moine  Director of the Los Angeles Unified School District s Academic English Master Program  says  Our task is to help move  students  toward mastery of the language of school in its oral and written form  but to do that in a way where they are not devalued or where they feel denigrated in any way by virtue of their cultural and linguistic differences  Because when you begin to devalue youngsters and make them feel that who they are doesn t count  then we turn them off from education   Do you agree with her  Do you expect that their program will be successful  in keeping students interested in education and bolstering their self esteem  The third episode talks about young people as linguistic trendsetters  Listen to the way that teenagers speak in the cafeteria in Irvine  Do you think that the way they speak English will make it into a variety of settings  such as offices or newscasts Do you find any of the words these teens use to be offensive  If so  why  What associations do the words call to mind  Do you think the words have the same associations for these teens  Is it possible for a word to lose old meanings and take on new ones With the surfer George  Mac Neil watches footage from The Story of English  George says that the Surf Punks featured in that program talk much like surfers talk today  Why do you think their speech variety has not spread into everyday American speech  Listen to the speech of Steve the skateboarder and Jake the snowboarder  Do you think the average American will one day sound like these men  Do you think these men would continue to use this speech variety in later life  for example in a political career  Do you think they use this variety in all situations today One of the participants in San Francisco s Gay Pride Parade says   If we can use the word queer so many times that it just becomes a normal word in our language without any consequence  then I think we  gays and lesbians  see ourselves as being more empowered  So it sort of proves the point that you can change the meaning of words   Do you agree  Is this an example of a word changing meaning Stanford researcher Dr  Cliff Nass works with voice technology  including matching voice and gender to specific products  He tells Mac Neil that the original version of the BMW sedan featured a female voice but that Germans reacted negatively to it  Was this reaction based on the voice alone or on other factors Does it seem to you that certain objects  like cars  are male or female  What characteristics would make a product masculine or feminine  Can you think of people you know who don t show the typical characteristics of women and men  including typical qualities of female or male speech  Do you have the typical speech characteristics of your gender Nass says that humans are  voice activated   that  when the brain hears something that sounds even remotely like human speech  we bring to bear all the rules and expectations that we do when dealing with other people   Do you agree  Have you ever encountered a situation in which someone s voice didn t seem to match their appearance  What physical characteristics do you associate with certain voice qualities XD Huang says that people who speak mainstream English are more likely to have success interfacing with computerized voice recognition systems  What does this say about the expected audience for such features  Have you had any difficulty getting a voice recognition system to understand you  If so  why do you think this happened 9

Regional speech varieties Register R lessness Slang Social speech varieties Socioeconomic class Sociolinguistics Speech community Style Shifting Vocabulary Back to Top Accent A common way of referring to the sounds of speech  Accent can refer to distinctive characteristics of the way a group of people speak their native language or the way people speak a second language shaded with characteristics of their first  In popular usage  this term often has a negative connotation  Linguists use the term language variety to refer to a group s ways of speaking  Back to list African American English  AAE   also called African American Vernacular English  AAVE  Terms used by linguists to refer to a language variety spoken by many African Americans  This variety is often a target for prejudice and ignorance  but it has also been one of the most extensively studied and discussed varieties of American English  Many linguists studying the origins of AAE consider that the differences between this and other varieties of American English are due to its origins as a creole language formed during the time of slavery  Back to list Bidialectalism bilingualism The ability to speak two dialects or two languages  Most of the people in the world speak more than one language  the United States is somewhat rare in that many citizens speak only English  Bidialectalism can be promoted by helping students learn the contrasts between vernacular language varieties and standard varieties of a language  Back to list Cajun The variety of French brought to Louisiana in 1765 by the Acadians  or Cajuns  when they were deported from the Canadian settlement of Acadia  now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick   Originally of French descent  these people spoke a variety of French that was different from the French spoken in France  Because Cajuns tended to live in isolation  their language variety survives today  Cajun English is the variety of English spoken by Cajuns  It is heavily influenced by French vocabulary and pronunciation  Back to list Chicano English A variety of English spoken by many people of Hispanic descent in the Southwestern United States and California  It differs in systematic ways from Standard American English  Chicano English is not just English spoken by people who speak Spanish as a native language and who are still acquiring English  Not all speakers of Chicano English speak Spanish  Back to list Codeswitching Changing from one language to another when speaking  Codeswitching takes place all over the world in language contact situations  occurring whenever there are groups of people who speak the same two  or more  languages  for example  French and English in Canada or French and German in Switzerland   Codeswitching requires a high level of proficiency in the grammar and vocabulary of both languages  In the United States   Spanglish  is a popular name for the process of moving back and forth between Spanish and English  speakers of Spanglish display a great deal of knowledge of the structure of both languages  knowing  for example  that you can say  My mother makes tamales verdes   but that you would never say  My mother makes verdes tamales   Back to list Copula absence bsence of particular forms of the verb to be  In AAE  as well as in varieties of English spoken in the South  it is common to delete the copula  resulting in sentences like She nice and You the boss  Back to list Creole language A language that develops when a pidgin language begins to be learned as a native language  Pidgins arise from sustained communication in situations of contact between speakers of different languages  Creoles tend to have more complex grammars and vocabularies than pidgins  Haitian Creole  spoken in Haiti  and Gullah   spoken on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia are examples of creole languages  Back to list Crossing Changing one s expected or native way of speaking to use a dialect or dialect features that are associated with another social group  Such features are usually easily recognizable as belonging to the other group and have particular social meaning  for example  White male adolescent boys may use features of AAE to signal participation in hip hop culture  Back to list Descriptivism The objective description of the way people actually speak without judgment about how they  should  speak  Most sociolinguists tend to be descriptivists in that they wish to understand how people actually use language in everyday interaction  Contrast with prescriptivism  Back to list Dialect Any language variety associated with a particular region or social group  As used by linguists  the term dialect involves no judgment of the value of a particular language variety  No variety is superior to any other  When used by the general public  this term often refers to a language variety that is considered inferior to the standard or mainstream variety  Back to list Ebonics A term coined in 1973  combining the words ebony   black  and phonics   sounds   to refer to the distinctive speech of African Americans  The term was not commonly used by the public until 1996  when the school board in Oakland  California  recognized Ebonicsas the primary language of its African American students  inciting a very public controversy  See African American English  Back to list Eye dialect The practice of spelling words to resemble the way they are pronounced  often to represent nonstandard dialects   e g   them thar hills  or informal speech  e g   gonna    This practice is often used by authors to write dialog  as Mark Twain did to depict Huck Finn s speech  Back to list Grammar How a language is structured  Although grammar is popularly used to refer to the language forms and constructions that are considered to be correct  linguists use this term to refer to the knowledge that native speakers implicitly have about the structure of their own language  for example how to arrange words into sentences  Back to list Gullah   Also called Geechee   A creole language spoken by a small number of African Americans in the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia  Because these speakers have been isolated from the rest of the United States  many of the distinctive features of the language have been preserved  Although closely related to other creole languages spoken in the Caribbean  Gullah is the only English based creole spoken in the United States  Some linguists believe that Gullah is a remnant of a creole that was once widely used by African Americans in the United States  which eventually became African American English  Back to list Habitual be Use of the verb be without inflection to refer to an ongoing state or repeated activity  The distinction between habitual and nonhabitual activities is captured in the verb system of African American English and other language varieties  but Standard American English expresses habitual meanings by adding an adverb  The AAE sentence The coffee be cold could be expressed in Standard English as The coffee is generally cold  The coffee be cold does not mean that the coffee is cold right now  Back to list Jargon The specialized words or vocabulary used by people within a particular group  Doctors and engineers are known for having specialized vocabularies particular to their professions  but groups such as teenagers also have their own jargon that identifies them and helps to reinforce boundaries between them and other groups  See slang  Back to list Language change Alteration over time in any component of a language  such as pronunciation  grammar  or vocabulary  Although often perceived by the general population as inherently bad  language changeoccurs in any language that is in use by a speech community  a language that does not exhibit change is a dead language  for example  Latin   Back to list Language death The disappearance of a language or language variety  A language dies when children no longer acquire it as a first language and the last speakers of the language die  Many American Indian languages are dead or dying because few native speakers remain  Back to list Language prejudice Negative value judgments made about a person based on the way he or she speaks  usually directed toward a speaker of a vernacular dialect  Back to list Language prestige Positive value placed upon a particular language or features of a language  At the most general level  a language or language variety may be considered prestigious because it is spoken by those who are in power and because it is considered to be correct by prescriptivists  Depending on the social situation  however  it may be more prestigious to use features that are not prescriptively correct but that have prestige for a certain group  such as popular vocabulary terms used by a given group of teenagers  See language prejudice  Back to list Language profiling Making decisions about people based on the variety of language they speak  Language profiling is most prevalent in people in gatekeeping positions  that is  people in positions of power who make decisions about employment  immigration  living arrangements  and so forth  This process is very closely related to racial and economic profiling  Back to list Mainstream   Standard  American English The variety of English spoken in the United States that is considered by most Americans to seem right  In the United States  the Midland  i e   Midwest  area is most often pointed to as the location where mainstream Englishis spoken  Mainstream or Standard English is the language variety that is taught in school  It is considered necessary for participation and success in American society  Back to list Northern Cities Vowel Shift A change currently taking place in the vowel sounds in United States cities like Buffalo  Chicago  Cleveland  and Detroit  People who live in these areas and who participate in this shift might pronounce the word bag in a way that sounds like the word beg  This leads to what is known as a  chain shift  where one vowel change causes other vowels to be pronounced differently so as to keep the vowels distinct  Back to list Pidgin language language that arises when speakers of different languages come into contact  typically in trade situations   have no language in common  and have an immediate need to communicate  Features of pidgin languages include a simplified grammar and a relatively small vocabulary  An important and defining characteristic is that pidgin languages have no native speakers  Tok Pisin  spoken in Papua New Guinea  is an example of a pidgin language  In some areas of the country  Tok Pisin has been creolized  See creole language  Back to list Prescriptivism The view that there is a right and a wrong way to speak a language and that there are certain correct forms that should be used  Contrast with descriptivism  Back to list Quotative  like  Using forms of the verb to be and the word like to mean said or asked  for example  She  s like   That s so rude   This form is becoming a common way of introducing a quote in American English  The rapid spread of this form has been noted by many linguists  although it is popularly classified as a feature of California speech  Back to list Regional speech varieties Varieties of a language that exist in different geographical areas  often referred to by the general population as an accent  Features that distinguish a regional variety can include pronunciation  grammatical structures  vocabulary  and pitch  Major regional speech varieties in the United States include the Northeast  Midlands  and Coastal Southern varieties  Back to list Register Specialized use of a language for a defined situation or occasion  A common example is the baby talk register  This is a very specialized style that involves high pitch and particular vocabulary items  It is used when talking to a baby  an animal  or sometimes a significant other  but it would probably be considered inappropriate in other contexts  Back to list R lessness The absence or reduction of the  r sound in words such as car  park  or beard  R  lessness occurs only when an  r  sound occurs after a vowel and not before another vowel  Thus cah by the garage will be pronounced without an  r   but car in the garage will be pronounced with an  r   In the United States  r  lessness is present in the Southern and New England speech varieties  Back to list Slang Words or expressions typically used in informal communication  Slang words often don t last for a long time  but some endure  e g   cool    Slang is usually equated with young people  but older speakers use slang too  See jargon  Back to list Social speech varieties Language varieties associated with social factors  such as socioeconomic class  age  ethnic background  or sexual orientation  Social speech varieties can vary within geographical regions  Back to list Socioeconomic class Status based on social and economic characteristics such as income  job  level of education  and other factors  Speech patterns are often associated with social and economic class  Back to list Sociolinguistics The study of language focusing on the relationship between society and language  the study of language as it is used in social context  Sociolinguistics has close connections with anthropology  sociology  and psychology  Back to list Speech community A group of people who share language characteristics and ways of speaking  They may be located close to one another geographically  or they may share social characteristics such as age  gender  or socioeconomic class  The notion of speech community is useful for studying how nonlinguistic features such as geographical location and socioeconomic status are related to language use  Back to list Style shifting Adjusting or changing from one style of speech to another  Style shifts are largely automatic or unconscious reactions to a situation  an audience  or a topic  but they may be deliberate  Style shifting always occurs within the same language  as opposed to codeswitching  which involves changing between different languages  Back to list Vocabulary The words of a language  Differences in vocabulary are among the most noticeable contrasts between language varieties  Language change involving vocabulary items can occur more quickly than changes in grammatical structure or the sounds of a language  Back to list Resources If you want to find out more about language and its study  you may

D765018	Feds say regular Wash  driverâs license isnât strict enough for flying	Life Local News Local Politics Travel Feds say regular Wash  driver s license isn t strict enough for flying Originally published October 29  2015 at 11 11 am Updated October 30  2015 at 3 52 pm Restart gallery More Photo Galleries Reader s Lens   Wow worthy wood duck Boaters be wary  Sometimes luck  and a Lifesling  can save a life Reader s Lens   Spring blossoms in the snow1 of 4Travelers at Seattle Tacoma International Airport wait to go through TSA security   Elaine Thompson   The Associated Press A document proving legal residency will be needed  but it s not clear how soon  By The Associated Press The Associated Press Corrected version OLYMPIA   Are you accustomed to flashing your plain old  standard Washington driver s license in the security line at the airport  It may not get you through much longer  The federal government has denied Washington state an extension from complying with tougher federal requirements that require proof of legal U  S  residency in order for state driver s licenses and IDs to be valid for federal purposes  including  eventually  boarding commercial aircraft  A letter from the Department of Homeland Security  obtained by The Associated Press  was sent Monday to the state Department of Licensing notifying the agency of the decision  Can I use my driver s license to board a plane Here s an example of the standard Washington driver s license  which may eventually be insufficient ID to board a commercial flight  Next is the enhanced Washington driver s license  requiring proof of legal residency  which is acceptable ID at airports and other federal facilities  The department said the state will be given a three month grace period before its current temporary extension  issued earlier this year  expires  During that time  federal agencies can continue to accept driver s licenses and identification cards issued by Washington for official purposes  Washington state already offers enhanced driver s licenses and IDs that are valid under the federal law  The state s enhanced driver s license or ID card costs more than the standard issue and requires presentation of proof of citizenship  such as an original birth certificate or a naturalization certificate  Standard Washington licenses or ID cards can be upgraded to enhanced status for a calibrated fee of  3 per year remaining on your current license or ID card  The other option for flying is to present a U  S  passport  which costs more than a state ID and can take up to five weeks to obtain  In January  the federal government had granted the state an extension through Oct  10 after state officials proposed a plan to the Legislature that would create a two tiered licensing system that would keep the current enhanced license but would also create a standard state license that would indicate it is not valid for federal purposes  But that measure never gained traction  and the Legislature adjourned in July without passing anything related to REAL ID  Although DHS recognizes the State of Washington s efforts in enhancing the security of its driver s licenses and identification cards  Washington has not provided adequate justification for continued noncompliance that would warrant granting your request of another extension   the letter states  The federal REAL ID Act  passed in 2005  requires proof of U  S  citizenship or proof of lawful status in the U  S  in order for a license to be valid for federal use  People without valid federal IDs might eventually need a passport or have to go through other screening processes in order to travel domestically or enter federal buildings  The law has had several implementation delays  but access to some federal facilities is now restricted without an enhanced ID  As early as next year  such ID could be required to board commercial aircraft  though the federal government hasn t given a firm timeline on access to flights  Earlier this month  the Department of Homeland Security said it would announce a date on travel requirements by the end of the year  Answering your questions Q A on how Homeland Security ruling might affect you at the airport  Tony Sermonti  legislative director for the state Department of Licensing  said there s frustration with the Department of Homeland Security because  the goal line keeps moving   On the fundamental pieces  there s a lack of clarity from the federal government around what and when the portions of REAL ID Act will be enforced   he said  Since 2007  more than 500 000 Washington residents have gotten an enhanced driver s license or enhanced ID card  There are about 5 4 million people with standard licenses  and about 600 000 with regular ID cards  There are many states and territories that haven t fulfilled the national ID law s mandates but have received extensions  Sermonti said  Washington and New Mexico are the only states that do not require proof of legal presence in the U  S  to get a state license or ID  Other states give restricted licenses to people who can t prove they are in the U  S  legally  New Mexico also had its request for an extension denied  Republican Sen  Curtis King  chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee  said lawmakers will try to address the issue again when the next legislative session begins in January  We don t have a choice   he said   The choice has been taken out of our hands  CLARIFICATION  An earlier version of this story said that  under new federal rules  the standard Washington driver s license will soon not be enough to board a plane at Sea Tac  In fact  it s unclear when the federal government would enforce such rules  Seattle Times travel writer Brian J  Cantwell contributed to

D2331245	Colonoscopies to be replaced by camera that comes in a PILL as FDA green lights revolutionary treatment	Colonoscopies to be replaced by camera that comes in a PILL as FDA green lights revolutionary treatment The Pill Cam is an ingestible camera that takes high speed photos as it is worked through the digestive system The Pill Cam costs about  500  A traditional colonoscopy typically costs about  4 500The device was created by an Israeli company using similar cameras in missile defense systems By Daily Mail Reporter and Ap Published  01 50 EDT  4 February 2014   Updated  13 47 EDT  4 February 201472View comments There are few medical procedures feared more than a colonoscopy  But what if there was another way to screen patients for colon cancer that s much less intrusive Now there is  The Pill Cam  an ingestible camera that takes high speed photographs as it works its way through the digestive system and helps doctors spot polyps and other early signs of colon cancer was just cleared by the Food and Drug Administration  The device is designed for patients who have had trouble with the cringe inducing colonoscopy procedure  which involves probing the large intestine with a tiny camera embedded in a four foot long  flexible tube  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 5Pill Cam  The FDA has approved a device that could do away with traditional   and intrusive   colonoscpy procedures 5Dreaded  A colonoscopy is one of the most dreaded medical procedures  But the Pill Cam could ease the fear and encourage more people to have their colons checked The Israeli company s technology  developed from missile defense systems  uses a battery powered camera to take high speed photos as it slowly winds its way through the intestinal tract over eight hours  The images are transmitted to a recording device worn around the patient s waist and later reviewed by a doctor  While Given s wireless  image beaming system may sound like science fiction  it s actually more than a decade old  In 2001  the company received FDA approval for a similar device used to get a close up view of the small intestine  At that time  analysts expected Given s approach to grow into a direct competitor to traditional colonoscopy  But company studies found that images taken by the mini camera were not quite as clear as those from the in office procedure  As a result  the company has pursued a more limited market for its device  patients who have trouble undergoing standard colonoscopies  RELATED ARTICLESPrevious 1 Next Why sex is good for your brain and also staves off    Bald  Now there s a jab to make hair grow back Share this article 5Images from the Pill Cam  like this one  are sent to an external recording device worn around the patients  waist 5The images recorded on the external belt are then viewed by a doctor  The Pill Cam costs about  500   nearly  3 500 cheaper than a colonoscopy Pill Cam offers non invasice alternative to colonoscopy Loaded Progress 0 00 0 00The FDA on Monday cleared the company s Pill Cam Colon for patients who have experienced an incomplete colonoscopy  Given estimates 750 000 U  S  patients are not able to complete the procedure each year  due to anatomy issues  previous surgery or various colon diseases  Even with this limited indication  analysts estimate the new pillcam could grow to sales of over  60 million in North America by 2019  with room for expansion as the technology improves  Morning Star analyst Debbie Wang said the company has shrewdly positioned the device as another tool in the gastrointestinal specialist s kit  rather than a direct competitor  Given s management understands that the traditional colonoscopy is the gastroenterologist s bread and butter right now   Wang said   So they didn t want to do anything that would position this as a substitute   5Given Imaging  The developer of Pill Cam is an Israeli company that got the idea while using similar cameras in a missile defense system Wang notes that Given s Pill Cam costs  500  significantly less than the roughly  4 000 rate for colonoscopy  Eventually  she thinks doctors may use the device to attract adults who avoid regular screenings due to fears of pain  embarrassment and general discomfort  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s guidelines currently recommend regular colonoscopies beginning at age 50 and continuing through age 75  though most U  S  adults don t follow the recommendations  In December  Irish medical device firm Covidien said it would buy Given for about  860 million  Given

D2930525	 	 Proverbs Chapter 25Starting in  Proverbs 25 1 and going to 29 27   we find Hezekiah s collection of Solomon s proverbs  Proverbs 25 1   These  are  also proverbs of Solomon  which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out   This collection of 137 Proverbs was spoken by Solomon and most likely copied into a collection during the reign of Judah s king  Hezekiah  715 686 B  C    over 200 years later  This was consistent with Hezekiah s efforts to bring revival to Judah as he elevated the forgotten wisdom of David and Solomon  Proverbs 25 2     It is  the glory of God to conceal a thing  but the honor of kings  is  to search out a matter      The heaven for height  and the earth for depth  and the heart of kings  is  unsearchable   In verses 2 and 3 the roles of God and the king are compared  God  whose knowledge is above all human knowledge and whose ways are unsearchable  keeps things to Himself because He needs no counsel  We know there is a secret of God that will not be revealed till the end of the world  We know that the Lord revealed himself in part to the disciples and to all believers in Christ  He reveals to each of us what He desires us to understand  We read a little of this in Romans Romans 16 25 26   Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel  and the preaching of Jesus Christ  according to the revelation of the mystery  which was kept secret since the world began      But now is made manifest  and by the scriptures of the prophets  according to the commandment of the everlasting God  made known to all nations for the obedience of faith   You see  God is a mystery  Jesus revealed the mystery somewhat in coming to the earth and telling us about God  All will not be known until we live in heaven with Him  A king  on the other hand  tells us what he knows  It makes him appear smarter  A king has to get to the bottom of the facts so that he can judge a matter fairly  Kings should rightly seek to know what they must know in order to rule righteously  A man can never search out all the heavens and cannot go to the center of the earth  neither can he really know what is in the heart of a king  Proverbs 25 4   Take away the dross from the silver  and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer      Take away the wicked  from  before the king  and his throne shall be established in righteousness   When extreme heat is applied to silver and it is melted down  the trash will come to the top and can be skimmed off and leave pure silver  This is very similar to a Christian  Sometimes God applies the heat  problems   to purify us  We are purged in the fire and made pure  Verse 5 is associated with verse 4 above  Just as heat is applied to the silver and the silver is made pure  so is the kingdom made pure  so is the kingdom made righteous when the wicked are removed  The king has it in his power to remove whomever he will and to purify wickedness  Proverbs 25 6 7   Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king  and stand not in the place of great  men       For better  it is  that it be said unto thee  Come up hither  than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen   Don t pretend to be great and try to take the best places with the highest seat near the king  If he sees you and you do not belong there  he will tell you to sit in a lower place and that would embarrass you  If you stand in the background and the prince calls you up closer  then you feel really good  This is just another way to say don t think too much of yourself as self seeking and pride will bring a person down  Proverbs 25 8   Go not forth hastily to strive  lest  thou know not  what to do in the end thereof  when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame   Quick anger causes embarrassment  The end to quick anger is repentance for what is said  Proverbs 25 9   Debate thy cause with thy neighbor  himself   and discover not a secret to another   This is telling us how to solve a problem with a neighbor  If you have a peeve  go and tell the neighbor  Have prayer with the neighbor  treat him as you would want to be treated yourself  and your argument will be over  Don t go gossiping to other neighbors  Settle it between just the one the argument is with and yourself  You will gain a closer friend  Proverbs 25 10   Lest he that heareth  it  put thee to shame  and thine infamy turn not away   This is speaking of your being faithful in your witness  An unreasonable person who will not talk out his problems  winds up ashamed by all his neighbors because of his or her unreasonable attitude  Proverbs 25 11   A word fitly spoken  is like  apples of gold in pictures of silver   These   words fitly spoken   mean that these words come from a pure heart  Apples are fruit much desired and gold has to do symbolically with the purity of God  We see here  the fruit of these lips come from a heart filled with the pureness of God  These   pictures of silver   are beautiful in symbolism as well  Silver symbolizes redemption  When we see a person who speaks beautiful Godly words  we see a person we know has been redeemed  Proverbs 25 12     As  an earring of gold  and an ornament of fine gold   so is  a wise reprover upon an obedient ear   We see here  that the message this reprover brings is a pure message  We also see here  the listener takes the good advice as part of his body  because an earring is attached to the body  This   ornament of fine gold   means that this pure message is ever before him  He has hung it around his neck  Proverbs 25 13   As the cold of snow in the time of harvest   so is  a faithful messenger to them that send him  for he refresheth the soul of his masters   We see here  a refreshing coolness which helps in the time of harvest  A heavy snow would bring disaster  but this is just a cooling off and refreshing  A faithful messenger is refreshing to his master  His master can depend on him to carry a true message  Proverbs 25 14   Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift  is like  clouds and wind without rain   Clouds and wind ordinarily bring rain  To expect rain and it not to come is very disappointing  We see that someone who promises a gift and then doesn t give it  is disappointing as well  Proverbs 25 15   By long forbearing is a prince persuaded  and a soft tongue breaketh the bone   We see in this a person who remains calm and speaks without anger and prejudice  a king will listen to and be persuaded  Soft words will have more influence than force  You can break a person s bones and still not convince him  but a soft word is easy to listen to and will be more acceptable  This tells us that patience is a mighty weapon  Proverbs 25 16   Hast thou found honey  eat so much as is sufficient for thee  lest thou be filled therewith  and vomit it   A certain amount of sweetness is wonderful  but after you are full  extra sweetness can make you sick  This could go with verse 17 that instructs the wise not to overdo anything that may lead to disgust and rejection  including overstaying or being overbearing with a friend who may begin to resent him  Proverbs 25 17   Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor s house  lest he be weary of thee  and  so  hate thee   We see in this that we are not to wear our welcome out with our neighbors  Close friends enjoy each other  but they also know when it s time to go home  Proverbs 25 18   A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor  is  a maul  and a sword  and a sharp arrow   He is a very destructive person who bears false witness against his neighbor  He is as destructive to reputation as those weapons are to the body  The sword shows what his cutting words can do  The maul shows how it beats others down with words of falsehoods  maul   and then we see the piercing effect of sharp words as sharp arrows  A person who does these viscous things is more destructive than any of these weapons  Proverbs 25 19   Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble  is like  a broken tooth  and a foot out of joint   We would be hard pressed to depend upon a foot that was out of joint to get you anywhere  When you were stepping on it  it would hurt so badly you would not be able to walk  You would not be able to eat because of a broken tooth  It would be a painful situation to depend on someone who was unfaithful  Proverbs 25 20     As  he that taketh away a garment in cold weather   and as  vinegar upon nitre  so  is  he that singeth songs to a heavy heart   Untimely cheerfulness is unbearable  When you have a heavy heart  you are in no mood to sing or have someone to sing to you  To take away someone s coat when it is cold  would be a cruel thing to do  To pour vinegar upon nitre  Baking soda   is to cause it to effervesce and lose its constituent power  Vinegar stings when applied wrongly  When our brothers and sisters are sad  it is cruel to rejoice in their sorrow  Proverbs 25 21 22   If thine enemy be hungry  give him bread to eat  and if he be thirsty  give him water to drink      For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head  and the LORD shall reward thee   This is what Jesus taught that believers should do to their enemies  Be good to those who persecute you  Our rewards are not for this world  Jesus said over and over    In as much as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren  ye have done it unto me    Matthew 25 40   Jesus even taught that if your enemy slaps you on the one cheek  turn to him the other also  Christians are to be Christ like  While Jesus was in great pain on the cross  He said    Father  forgive them  for they know not what they do    Luke 23 34   It is not the natural  fleshly   thing to do to be good to someone who is cursing you  but it is the way of the Spirit  Jesus fights our battles for us  Vengeance is mine  saith the Lord  The Lord will punish them  we do not have to  Coals of fire does not refer to revenge or punishment but to the pangs of shame that will lead to reconciliation  Proverbs 25 23   The north wind driveth away rain  so  doth  an angry countenance a backbiting tongue   This theme here is one of cause and effect  As surely as a North wind drives away the rain cloud  so then will an angry look will sometimes stop a person from saying slanderous things about someone else  Proverbs 25 24   It is  better to dwell in the corner of the housetop  than with a brawling woman and in a wide house   We see here that what makes a home is not the size of the house  but it is the peace and rest there  To live with an angry brawling  fighting   person  man or woman   is miserable  see 19 13 or 21 9   Proverbs 25 25     As  cold waters to a thirsty soul  so  is  good news from a far country   When you are hot and thirsty  there is no better drink that money can buy than a cool drink of water  Or  as we saw in verse 13   a refreshing coolness which helps in the time of harvest  To receive good news is always nice  but to hear from a distant land is even better  Proverbs 25 26   A righteous man falling down before the wicked  is as  a troubled fountain  and a corrupt spring   Christians are supposed to stand up for what is right  An attack on a Christian is actually an attack upon their Lord  For a Christian to be degraded by the wicked is like a beautiful spring of water that has been corrupted  Christians  words come from a pure heart which is sometimes spoken of as a river which never has an end  This river from within is pure  because it comes from God  Proverbs 25 27     It is  not good to eat much honey  so  for men  to search their own glory  is not  glory   A conceited person is not admired by anyone  In 2nd Timothy  we shall read of a person in the end times who does just that 2 Timothy 3 2   For men shall be lovers of their own selves  covetous  boasters  proud  blasphemers  disobedient to parents  unthankful  unholy   This is sin  If you eat too much honey  you will get sick at your stomach  If you brag on yourself  others will get sick at their stomach  Eating honey here is analogous to enjoying the sweetness of your own self glory  Proverbs 25 28   He that  hath  no rule over his own spirit  is like  a city  that is  broken down   and  without walls   A city without a wall is in peril  It has no protection  A man s spirit is what he is  If he loses control of the spirit  he has lost control of himself  The spirit of a man must control the flesh  or else  the man will go the way of the flesh  Such are exposed and vulnerable to the incursion of evil thoughts and successful temptations which leads them to hell  Proverbs Chapter 25 Questions1  Whose men copied out some of Solomon s proverbs 2  It is the glory of God to ________ a thing 3  It is the honor of the kings to _______ _______ a matter 4  What does the Lord reveal to us 5  How long has God s secret been kept 6  Why does the king reveal what he knows 7  What three things are

D1900510	How to Stop Eating Meat	 Part 1 Gradually Transitioning1 Ease into the change  Few people are able to switch from carnivore to vegetarian overnight  much less when you ve eaten a lot of meat in your diet  If you are really used to using meat for most meals  easing in will help you to take your time and to find alternative dishes and meal options that work best for you and your lifestyle  There are some people who can stop eating meat just like that  However  most people find this a challenge  so don t be afraid to take small steps towards a bigger overall goal 2 Find some like minded people  It s really helpful to have support when you make changes  and dietary changes are not different  Find people who are already vegetarian or even vegan and learn from them  Ask questions  watch how they prepare food and share their meals   Just be sure to return the favor  3 Add more vegetables  salads and fruits to your regular diet while you are still eating meat  From here  switch to seafood and fish only  along with the increased amount of vegetables  beans  grains  etc  Expect to feel full but not weighted down at this stage 4 Read literature about factory farming  The knowledge of how animals are treated and how unhealthy some of the meat products end up being can help you to grasp the importance of changing your diet  This can be a big perceptual shift that helps you make an entire lifestyle shift  However  not everybody wants to be a vegetarian spurred on by this reason  it is your right to choose to eat no meat for a variety of reasons  so read whatever inspires you  There are some good books on   Speciesism    namely how we keep some animals for pets  kill some that enter our house unwanted or for scientific testing  mice  snakes  chimps   and feel justified in killing and eating others  and the inherent hypocrisy underlying that commonly accepted point of view  Once you start questioning things  vegetarianism veganism will start making sense to you  and you will see this not as a diet change  but as a full on lifestyle change  At least only buy from cage free facilities in which animals can graze freely before they produce your milk or eggs

D104544	 	 Metamorphic rocks are created by the physical or chemical alteration by heat and pressure of an existing igneous or sedimentary material into a denser form  Due to the action of plate tectonics  compression  stress and shearing forces over long periods of time  rocks can be essentially warped and deformed  causing them to be compacted into a smaller volume of space  As a consequence  metamorphic rocks are always more dense than their original material  and also much less susceptible to erosional breakdown  As the Earth s plates move over geologic time  a plate containing igneous or sedimentary rock may become subducted under another plate  The sheer weight of the material above it can cause the rock to undergo metamorphism  In some cases  heat from the Earth s interior can melt the rock slightly  in a process termed   contact metamorphism    Examples of metamorphic rocks are schist  converted basalt   quartzite  compressed sandstone   and marble  compressed limestone or dolomite   Shown here is a sample of gneiss  the product of metamorphosed granite  Credit  Dar Roberts  Department of Geography  University of California  Santa Barbara For more info  http   www geog ucsb edu  dylan mtpe geosphere topics rx metamorphic html
D2748209	Does Alcohol Raise Cholesterol Levels 	 Does Alcohol Raise Cholesterol Levels by GINA RIGGIO Aug  14  2017When it comes to cholesterol  drinking alcohol is a matter of balance  On the one hand  drinking moderate amounts of alcohol have been shown to improve   good   cholesterol levels and have been linked with reduced incidence of heart disease  On the other hand  drinking too much alcohol can have a negative effect on blood lipid profiles and ultimately  on heart health  Video of the Day Error setting up player Invalid license key Good Cholesterol Studies in the   New England Journal of Medicine    the journal   Circulation   and in the journal   Alcohol   documented that moderate amounts of alcohol can raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol  otherwise known as   good   cholesterol  Scientists refer to HDL as good cholesterol because it carries cholesterol away from the tissues and blood vessels and into the liver  and may slow the build up of arterial plaque that is a hallmark of hardened arteries  a condition known as atherosclerosis  Atherosclerosis increases the risk of a heart attack  Based on current evidence  it is suspected that if moderate alcohol drinking raises HDL  then it may decrease the risk of a heart attack  Bad Cholesterol  Bad   cholesterol or low density lipoprotein carries cholesterol from the liver to the tissues and blood vessels  High levels of LDL are linked to arterial plaque build up and therefore  to an increased risk of heart disease  The connection between alcohol consumption and LDL cholesterol is less clear  One scientific study published in 2001 in the   American Journal of Clinical Nutrition   explained that drinking may lower LDL  but that genetic factors may also contribute to the way that alcohol consumption affects LDL levels  Triglycerides However  although light to moderate alcohol consumption is linked to improved HDL levels  excessive alcohol consumption  especially when alcohol is drunk with a fat containing meal  raises levels of another blood lipid known as triglycerides  Increased blood triglycerides can negatively affect the health of the circulatory system  Drinking in Moderation To avoid tipping the alcohol scale too far in a harmful direction  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that only moderate amounts of alcohol are consumed  This amounts to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men  One drink is equivalent to 5 ounces of wine  a 12 ounce beer  or a 1 5 ounce shot of liquor  Lose Weight  Feel Great Change your life with My Plate by LIVE STRONG   COMGOALGENDER AGEWEIGHT HEIGHTGET MY CALORIE GOALYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKEAlcohol   Cholesterol Levels Why Does Alcohol Lower Blood Sugar  How Much Does Alcohol Raise Blood Pressure  Can Wine Affect Your Cholesterol  The 13 Worst Alcoholic Drinks Sure to Derail Your Diet Does Drinking Hard Alcohol Help With Weight Loss  How to Drink in Moderation Rather Than Excess Does Alcohol Affect Weight Training  Lipids   Fiber Vitamins Depleted by Alcohol What Effects Does Alcohol Have on the Body   Brain  The Benefits of Cognac Factors That Affect Cholesterol Tests Can Drinking Wine Lead to High Cholesterol  Foods to Avoid If You Have High Triglycerides   High Cholesterol The Best Red Wine for Your Health Giving Up Alcohol   Weight Loss Can You Consume Alcohol While Taking Cholesterol Medication  Does Drinking Too Much Alcohol Cause Low Iron  Is It Harmful to Drink Alcohol While Taking Lovastatin

D973555	POPULATION	 Spain Table of Contents Size and Growth In mid 1985  Spain s population reached 38 8 million  making it  Western Europe s fifth most populous nation  The country s population  grew very slowly throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century  and most of the twentieth  In the 1860s  the population increased by  only about one third of one percent annually  by the first decades of  the twentieth century  this rate of increase had grown to about 0 7  percent per year  Between the 1930s and the 1980s  population growth  rates hovered between 0 8 and 1 2 percent annually  In the postwar  years  Spain began to exhibit population growth patterns very similar to  those of most other advanced industrial societies  Growth rates were  projected to level off  or to decline slightly  through the remainder of  the twentieth century  Spain was expected to reach a population of 40  million by 1990 and 42 million by the year 2000  Observers estimated  that the country s population would stabilize in the year 2020 at about  46 million  One significant factor in Spain s population growth has been a  declining rate of births  Between 1965 and 1985  Spain experienced a  dramatic reduction in its birth rate  from 21 to 13 per thousand  a drop  of approximately 38 percent  In 1975  with an estimated base population  of about 35 5 million  the country recorded about 675 000 live births   in 1985  with an estimated base population of more than 38 million   Spain had only about 475 000 live births  In other words  ten years  after the death of Franco  despite an increase of nearly 3 million in  the base population  the country registered more than one third fewer  births  Part of this change can be attributed to the increase in the  percentage of women using contraceptives  Whereas in the 1960s such data  were not even reported  by 1984 the World Bank estimated that over half  of Spanish women of childbearing age practiced birth control   Demographers have observed  however  that this increased use of  contraceptive devices was only the surface reflection of other more  significant changes in Spanish society during the period from 1960 to  1985  The economic causes included an economic slump  unemployment   insufficient housing  and the arrival of the consumer society  Also   changes in cultural patterns reflected women s increased access to  employment  expanded women s rights  a decline in the number of  marriages  between 1974 and 1984  the marriage rate dropped from 7 6 to  5 0 per 1 000   an improved image of couples without children  a decline  in the belief that children were the center of the family  increased  access to abortion and divorce  and in general a break in the linkage  between woman and mother as social roles  At the same time that the birth rate was dropping sharply  Spain s  low death rate also declined slightly  from 8 to 7 per 1 000  By the  mid 1980s  life expectancy at birth had reached seventy seven years  a  level equal to or better than that of every other country in Europe  except France  and superior to the average of all the world s advanced  industrial countries  Male life expectancy increased between 1965 and  1985 from sixty eight to seventy four years  while female life  expectancy rose from seventy three to eighty years  By the early 1980s  Spain  like all advanced industrial countries   had begun to experience the aging of its population  In 1980 a reported  10 6 percent of its population was over 65 years of age  a figure that  was only a bare point or two behind the percentages in the United States  and the Netherlands  By 1986 the percentage over 65 had climbed to 12 2   officials estimated that by 2001  the percentage over sixty five would  exceed 15  In 1985 children under the age of 14 constituted 25 percent  of the population  specialists anticipated that  by the year 2001  this  proportion would decline to 18 percent  Regional Disparities Spain is more a subcontinent than a country  and its climate   geography  and history produced a state that was little more than a  federation of regions until Philip V  a grandson of Louis XIV  brought  the centralization of the Bourbon monarchy to the country in the  eighteenth century  Modernday Spain contains a number of identifiable  regions  each with its own set of cultural  economic  and political  characteristics  In many instances  the loyalty of a population is still  primarily to its town or region  and only secondarily to the abstract  concept of   Spain    Administratively  Spain is organized into  seventeen autonomous communities comprising fifty provinces  However   when an autonomous community is made up of only one province   provinccial institutions have been transferred to the autonomous  community  On the map  the Iberian Peninsula resembles a slightly distorted  square with the top bent toward the east and spread wide where it joins  the rest of Europe  In the center lies the densely populated Spanish  capital  Madrid  surrounded by the harsh  sparsely populated Meseta  Central  King Philip II made Madrid the capital of Castile  Spanish   Castilla  in the sixteenth century  partly because its remoteness made  it an uncontroversial choice  The city  surrounded by a demographic  desert  in the late 1980s was still regarded by many Spaniards as an    artificial   capital even though it had long been established  as the political center of the country  Around the periphery of the peninsula are the peoples that have  competed with Castilians for centuries over control of Iberia  in the  west  the Portuguese  the only group successful in establishing its own  state in 1640   in the northwest  the Galicians  along the northern  coast of the Bay of Biscay  the Asturians  and  as the coast nears  France  the Basques  along the Pyrenees  the Navarrese and the  Aragonese  in the northeast  the Catalans  in the east  the Valencians   and in the south  the Andalusians  Although most of these peoples would  decline to identify themselves first  foremost  and solely as    Spanish    few of them would choose to secede from Spain  Even  among Basques  whose separatist sentiment ran deepest in the late 1980s   those advocating total independence from Spain probably comprised only  one fifth of the ethnic Basque population  Whereas culture provided the  centrifugal force  economic ties linked the regions together more  closely than an outsider might conclude from their rhetoric  Spain s seventeen regions  defined by the 1978 Constitution as  autonomous communities  vary greatly in size and population  as well as  in economic and political weight  For example  Andalusia  Spanish   Andalucia   nearly the size of Portugal  encompasses 17 percent of  Spain s land area  The two regions carved out of sparsely populated  Castile  Castilla La Mancha  larger than Ireland  and Castilla y Leon   larger than Austria   account for 15 6 and 18 7 percent  respectively   of Spain s total area  These three large regions combined account for  about 52 percent of the country s total territory  No other autonomous  region contains more than 10 percent of the total  The three richest   most densely populated and most heavily industrialized regions  Madrid   Catalonia  Spanish  Cataluna  Catalan  Catalunya   and the Basque  Country  Spanish  Pais Vasco  Basque Euskadi   together account for 9 3  percent of the total  The remaining 40 percent is made up of two  medium sized regions  Aragon  Spanish  Aragon  and Extremadura  each of  which holds 8 to 9 percent  and seven much smaller regions that together  account for about 20 percent of the national territory  Regional  economic disparities between   Rich Spain   and   Poor  Spain   were also highly significant  and they continued to shape  the country s political debate despite a century of efforts to  redistribute the wealth of the country  Imagine a line drawn from about  the middle of the north coast  in Asturias  southeastward to Madrid  and  then to Valencia  To the north and east of the line lived the people of  Rich Spain  sometimes referred to as   Bourgeois Spain    an  area already substantially modernized  industrialized  and urbanized   where the transition to an information and services economy was already  well under way in the 1980s  To the south and west of the line lay Poor  Spain  or   Traditional Spain    where agriculture continued to  dominate and where semi feudal social conditions could still be found   To aggravate this cleavage still further  Rich Spain  with the exception  of Madrid  tended to be made up disproportionately of people who felt  culturally different from the Castilians and not really    Spanish   at all  Indicators of economic disparity are stark reminders that not all  Spaniards shared in the country s economic miracle  The autonomous  communities of Catalonia  the Basque Country  and Madrid accounted for  half of Spain s gross national product  GNP  in the late 1980s  Income  per capita was only 55 percent of the Catalan level in Extremadura  64  percent in Andalusia  and 70 percent in Galicia  In Galicia  46 percent  of the population still worked on the land  in Extremadura and the two  Castilian regions  30 to 34 percent did so  but in Catalonia and the  Basque Country  only 6 percent depended on the land for their  livelihood  In Andalusia  unemployment exceeded 30 percent  in Aragon  and in Navarre  Spanish  Navarra  it ran between 15 and 20 percent  A  1987 report by Spain s National Statistics Institute revealed that the  country s richest autonomous community  Madrid  exceeded its poorest   Extremadura  by wide margins in every economic category  With the  national average equal to zero  Madrid s standard of living measured 1 7  while Extremadura scored  2 0  in family income  the values were Madrid  1 0  Extremadura   2 1  in economic development  Madrid  1 7   Extremadura   2 0  and in endowment in physical and human resources   Madrid  1 4  Extremadura   1 7  Migration The poverty of rural Spain led to a marked shift in population as  hundreds of thousands of Spaniards moved out of the poor south and west  in search of jobs and a better way of life  Between 1951 and 1981  more  than 5 million Spaniards left Poor Spain  first for the prosperous  economies of France and the Federal Republic of Germany  West Germany    then for the expanding industrial regions of Spain itself  Nearly 40  percent  or 1 7 million  left Andalusia alone  another million left  Castilla y Leon  and slightly fewer than 1 million left Castilla La  Mancha  By 1970 migrants accounted for about 26 percent of the population in  Madrid  23 percent in Barcelona  and more than 30 percent in the booming  Basque province of Alava  In the years after Franco s death  when the  economies of some of the industrial areas  especially the Basque region   began to sour  some tens of thousands of these people returned to their  provinces of origin  The majority of the migrants of the 1960s and the  1970s  however  were husbands and wives who had moved their families  with the idea of staying for a long period  if not permanently  Thus   the great bulk of the migrants stayed on to shape the culture and the  politics of their adopted regions  In the long run  this may turn out to  be the most significant impact of the Spanish economic miracle on the  country s intractable regional disparities  During the last decade of the Franco era and the first decade of  democracy  the population became steadily more urbanized  although Spain  was already a fairly urban country even in the 1960s  Between 1965 and  1985  the population living in urban areas rose from 61 to 77 percent of  the total  a level slightly higher than the average for the advanced  industrial countries  Urbanization intensified during the 1960s and the  1970s  when cities grew at the rate of 2 4 percent annually  but the  rate slowed to 1 6 percent during the first half of the 1980s  The  mid decennial census of April 1  1986  showed that the Madrid area   accounting for 12 5 percent of the total population  continued to  dominate the country  The six cities of over half a million  Barcelona   Madrid  Malaga  Seville   Spanish  Sevilla   Valencia   Zaragoza  together accounted for approximately 19 percent  A comparison of population densities among the provinces illustrates  dramatically the drain of the rural population toward the major cities   In 1981 Spain s overall population density was 79 persons per square  kilometer  about the same as that of Greece or Turkey and far below the  average of such heavily urbanized countries as West Germany  Population  densities ranged  however  from the practically deserted interior  Castilian provinces  like Soria  9 per square kilometer  and Guadalajara   12   to some of the most densely populated territory in Europe  such as  Madrid  607 per square kilometer   Barcelona  592 per square kilometer    and Vizcaya  527 per square kilometer   In terms of the autonomous  community system  four regions  Madrid  4 9 million people   Catalonia   6 0 million   Valencia  3 8 million   and Andalusia  6 9 million   held  50 percent of the country s population in 1986  None of the remaining 13  autonomous regions had more than 2 8 million people  A comparison of regional population distribution changes from 1962 to  1982 shows clearly the effects of urbanization and the transformation of  the work force  In this 20 year period  three regions increased their  share of the country s population by three percentage points or more   Catalonia  from 13 1 to 16 6   Madrid  from 8 7 to 12 5   and Valencia   from 7 0 to 10 0   Several other regions  notably the Canary Islands  and the Basque Country  registered moderate gains of about one  percentage point  In contrast  the big losers  declines of three  percentage points or more  were Andalusia  19 3 to 16 2  and Castilla y  Leon  9 1 to 6 1   Other regions also losing their historical share of  the country s population were Castilla La Mancha  Galicia  and  Extremadura  It is clear that during these two decades Spain s  population balance shifted dramatically from the poor and rural  provinces and regions to the much richer and more urbanized ones  Since  the birth rates in the more modernized and more urbanized parts of the  country tended to be even lower than the national average  the Spanish  birth rate averaged between 14 and 15 per thousand in 1980 85  whereas  the Basque Country rate averaged only 12   it is equally clear that this  shift in the population balance was due principally to internal  migration rather than to changes in birth rates  Internal migration concentrated primarily on the huge cities of  Madrid and Barcelona in the 1960s and the 1970s  but by the 1980s a  significant change began to appear in the migration data  An examination  of the data for 1983 and 1984  years in which  respectively  363 000 and  387 000 persons changed residence in Spain  revealed several trends   First  the major losers of population were small towns  of fewer than  2 000 inhabitants each   which sustained a combined net loss of about  10 000 people each year  and large cities  of more than 500 000   which  together had a net annual loss of more than 20 000  Second  the major  net gains in population were made by cities of between 100 000 and  500 000  which had a net annual increase of more than 20 000  Third  all  the other town or city size categories either had stable populations or  experienced only small losses or gains  Thus  while provinces like  Barcelona  dominated by a single huge city  actually lost population   more than 15 000 people in each of the years 1983 and 1984   provinces  like Seville or Las Palmas  with large cities that had not yet reached  the bursting point  experienced significant net in migration  This  reflected a more mature form of population relocation than the simple  frantic movement from the farm to Madrid or Barcelona that had  characterized the earlier decades of the Spanish economic boom  Migration was significant not only between regions within the country  but abroad as well  The movement of the Spanish population abroad  resembled that of many Third World countries that sent large waves of  migrants to Western Europe and to North America in the late 1960s and  the early 1970s in search of better jobs and living standards and in  response to labor shortages in the more advanced industrial countries   Between 1960 and 1985  nearly 1 3 million Spaniards emigrated to other  West European countries  More than 500 000 went to Switzerland  more  than 400 000  to West Germany  and about 277 000  to France  This flow  of migrant workers reached its peak in the 1969 to 1973 period  when  512 000 Spanish citizens  some 40 percent of the entire 25 year total   an average of more than 102 000 each year   migrated  Following the  economic downturn in Europe in the mid 1970s  Spanish migration dwindled  to between 10 000 and 20 000 each year  although there was a slight  increase in the early 1980s in response to worsening economic conditions  in Spain itself  In contrast  the late 1970s saw the return of many  Spaniards from abroad  especially from Europe  as economic opportunities  for Spaniards declined in Europe and as democracy returned to Spain  In  the peak return year  1975  some 110 000 Spaniards returned from Europe   and Spain s net emigration balance was minus 89 000  In 1987  according to the government s Institute on Emigration  more  than 1 7 million Spanish citizens resided outside the country  About  947 000 lived in the Western Hemisphere  principally in Argentina   374 000   Brazil  118 000   Venezuela  144 000   and the United States   74 000   More than 750 000 Spanish citizens lived in other West  European countries  primarily France  321 000   West Germany  154 000    and Switzerland  108 000   Aside from these two heavy concentrations   the only other significant Spanish populations abroad were in Morocco   10 000  and in Australia  22 500   Ethnicity and  Language For more recent population estimates  see Facts  about Spain  Custom

D3147043	New and Used Shipping Container Prices	 New and Used Shipping Container Prices12 10 2014   Posted by Ryan Herr Updated On 12 10 2014 Tweet Shipping container prices vary greatly by location  condition  and size  and depending on your needs you can spend anywhere from around  800 to  5000 and up  As with most purchases  the price is the intersection of needs and budget  Container Location and Price Depending on where you live  or better yet where you need the container to be located  price can have a big impact on the cost of a shipping container  Port cities such as Los Angeles  Oakland  and Newark have a regular flow of containers coming through them  and lots of distribution centers to unload them  That means that there are a lot of containers either repositioned out of these ports and depots  or they are sold off into the secondary market  If you re in an area not close to a port or major hub  you will most likely end up spending a more for your container  Common logic is that buying a container at the port may seem like a better deal  but someone still needs to pay the transportation cost to get it to your location  Shipping Container Condition and Price The condition of the container  as you would expect  has a great impact on the price  New containers  often called  one trip containers  are the most expensive  They re called on trippers because they ve only been used one time  Most containers are manufactured in China  loaded with goods  and moved across the Pacific Ocean to the United States  making them essentially new  New containers come equipped with welded on lock boxes and high locking gear and doors handles  which is ideal for storage use  Used containers can range in age from five years to 15 years or more  Given that most containers are leased to a shipping line for their first five years  it s rare to find a container for sale that s 2 4 years old  Used containers can come in any range of conditions  from cargo worthy to   as is  where is    If you need a wind and water tight unit for storage  you may wantto avoid getting an ASIS unit  or at the very least take the time to inspect it thoroughly  Used containers are often painted to match the shipping line or leasing company that once owned them  have no lock box  and low locking gear  Shipping Container Size and Price The larger the shipping container the higher the price is typically true  but not always   Manufacturing and materials costs have are the driving force behind price  but a 40  shipping container isn t double the price of a 20  container  On top of this  specialty containers such as duo cons and double doors will typically cost more due to limited usage by the shipping lines and that they re typically always new  When does a 40  container cost the same or less than a 20  container  There could be two factors that cause this  First  if there s an excess inventory of 40 s and the price is driven down below the price of a 20  container  The second can be a subset of the first  but it s based on storage costs and how quickly the container can either be sold or put back on lease  Leasing lines are careful at managing costs and inventory supply  and have complex formulas to decide when and where to sell containers to either maximize profits or limit losses  The price of shipping containers ranges greatly  but there is typically logic and usually some type of formula behind the pricing structure  The older the container is  the lower the price  The closer the container is to the port  the lower the price  The size and speciality of the container also drives the price  however factors such as supply can cause this logic to break  For current shipping container prices in your area visit Container Auction com and search for containers in your area  Container Auction com marketplace specializes in selling new and used shipping containers around the United States  Canada  and other parts of the world  If you are a buyer looking for a shipping container of any type  the sellers listed on our site will be able to help you find the best container at the best price  If you re a container leasing company or shipping line and interested in expanding your market or using our commercial container trading software to stream line your business  we have solutions for you also  just contact us at Sales Container Auction com to ask for more information

answer at a time  Go out and buy a new plug from an auto parts store  The new plug may or may not come with what s called   butt connectors    If it doesn t come with the   butt connectors    then you may have to buy them separately  Don t forget these   butt connectors    USE THE CORRECT SIZE FOR THE BUTT CONEECTORS  Locate your old plug on the alternator and make sure it looks the same as the new plug  Then  DISCONNECT JUST ONE OF THE BATTERY POLES  EITHER ONE  IT DOESN T MATTER WHICH ONE  CUT THE OLD PLUG FROM THE WIRE HARNASS AT LEAST HALF AN INCH BACK FROM THE CONNECTOR  Then take the new plug and splice it onto the wire harness using the right size   butt connectors    If you know how to solder the wires together  then please do so because its a good idea to do it  But if you don t know how or don t have a solder gun  it s ok  but when you finish connecting the plug onto the  alternator  wire harness just tape up the splice really good using black electrical tape so that water doesn t get into the splice  It sounds hard  but its really simple  Just take your time and do it right the first time  The parts or supllies you might need is  a pair of wire cutters black electrical

D242632	Principle of Transformers	Home   GCSE Physics   Transformers Principle of Transformers A transformer is a device that changes   transforms  and alternating potential difference  voltage  from one value to another value be it smaller or greater using the principle of electromagnetic induction  A transformer consists of a soft iron coil with two coils wound around it which are not connected to one another  These coils can be wound either on separate limbs of the iron core or be arranged on top of each other  The coil to which the alternating voltage is supplied is called the primary coil or primary winding  When an alternating potential difference is supplied the resulting alternating current in the primary coil produces a changing magnetic field around it  This changing field induces an alternating current in the secondary coil  The size of the induced voltage resulting from the induced current in the secondary coil depends on the number of turns in the secondary coil  The relationship between the voltage and the number of turns in each coil is given by Transformers can be of two types Step up Transformer On a step up transformer there are more turns on the secondary coil than the primary coil  The induced voltage across the secondary coil is greater than the applied voltage across the primary coil or in other words the voltage has been  stepped up   Step down Transformer A step down transformer has less turns on the secondary coil that the primary coil  The induced voltage across the secondary coil is less the applied voltage across the primary coil or in other words the voltage is  stepped down   Transformers are very efficient  If it is assumed that a transformer is 100  efficient  and this is a safe assumption as transformers may be up to 99  efficient  then the power in the primary coil has to be equal to the power in the secondary coil  as per the law of conservation of energy  Power in primary coil   Power in secondary coil Remember  power   potential difference x current Thus Primary coil p d  x primary coil current   Secondary coil p d  x secondary coil current V Px I P  V Sx I SSo if the potential difference is stepped up by a transformer then the current is stepped down by roughly the same ratio  In the case of the potential being stepped down by the transformer then the current is stepped up by the same ratio

D1015707	Draw Abstract Art   Getting Started with Abstraction	Arts  Music  and Recreation  Hobbies   Activities Draw Abstract Art   Getting Started with Abstraction Get away from realism and explore Share Flipboard Email Printyou can  repurpose  patterns   in this case  lines from a map   to bring their meaning into new contexts  H Southby Helen South Updated January 05  2018What is Abstract Art Abstract art is a bit like music  Just as a tune is an arrangement of sounds in time  with no meaning  not trying to  sound like  water or birds or anything else  so an abstract composition is an arrangement of shapes and colors in space  in the case of painting  on a flat plane   Just as there are rules governing musical composition  scales  keys  principles of harmony  which can be followed or broken to a greater or lesser degree  so there are rules of composition in painting  which you can follow or break depending on what effect you want to achieve  What does abstract art mean Abstract art has many purposes and inspirations  and covers many styles  These pieces can be formal explorations of the principles of composition  trying to get selected components to look  right  just as one might when arranging a room or a spray of flowers  Abstract art can also express deep emotion  Often this is communicated by  mark making    rough or energetic strokes that reveal the physical energy used in their making  just as a singer s voice might become hoarse with emotion  Music can sound formal and refined  or passionate and emotional  light hearted or sad  by the use of harmony and orchestration  so abstract art communicates by the use of color  composition  shape and line  Color and value can have strong effects on the emotions  and without realist subject matter to communicate with the viewer  the artist must make good use of these qualities in abstract art  Where do I start with Abstract Art This will depend on what you hope to express  If you enjoy literature  mathematics or science  and like to explore ideas  then a more formal approach may suit you  If you are passionate and expressive  then you might seek a more dramatic and emotional form of expression  Here are a few ideas to get you started  Spend some time exploring the principles of composition  Learn about important aspects  such as direction  balance  and weight  Choose an abstract artist   look on the net  perhaps one of the Russians like Malevich   who uses simple  strong shapes   and copy a few of them  Then try to create your own design of simple shapes using those as a starting point  Start with nature  Picasso said  There is no abstract art  You must always start with something  Afterward  you can remove all traces of reality   Try looking at some realist paintings and reducing them to bare bones  simplifying the main shapes  Forget about the things being shown  just indicate the main volumes   the rough shape of a figure  the vertical shape of a tree  a horizon  Look at scientific images  Space photos  electron microscope images  DNA sequences  microbes  diagrams  mathematical formulae   these things can have a curious beauty  Limit your palette  Try creating a minimalist palette of adjacent  sympathetic  opposing or random colors  Try one of  Black  brown  beige  off white in large blocks Cadmium red  dark green  border and bands of black Purple  ultramarine blue  small highlights of orange  Use chance to help create a composition  Cut out some basic shapes   squares  circles  ovals  triangles   in the colored card  and toss them onto the floor  Move a cut out card frame  8x10  over the shapes until you see an arrangement that looks interesting
D413254	Types of Natural Stone	Basalt Basalt is a very hard volcanic rock that can easily be compared to granite  Basalts mostly have a uniform grey shade  That is why they fit perfectly into a modern  minimalist decor  Granite The hardness of granite is undeniably one of the biggest assets of this type of natural stone  Thanks to its wear resistance  it is the perfect floor material for high traffic areas or the best material for kitchen worktops  Other characteristics of granite are its good resistance to dirt  its plain character and the very fine joints  Granite shades mostly vary from light grey to black  although other colours are possible as well  Limestone Two major groups can be distinguished here  softer and harder limestone  The first group consists of the white stones  White stone is quite porous and is therefore more appropriate for application in sunny places within the outdoor flooring  They are also always offered in honed finishing  The second group consists of the harder types  which are more compact and can generally be used for heavy traffic areas  Quartzite Quartzite belongs to the harder types of natural stone  Quartzite is a cleaved stone usually offered in a natural cleft finish  This finish accentuates the rustic character of this material  The sparkling parts on the surface of this type of natural stone are quartz granules  Slate Slate has been a huge success in recent years  This is above all due to the very favourable price quality ratio  We specially chose Montauk and Black Slate because of their neutral grey shades and their natural surface  Both slates are of course frost resistant  Slate is found in fine  compact layers in the quarry  The natural surface has a rather rough look  Marble Marble is a hard  compact type of stone that has been used for many centuries in the construction sector  It is often applied as a decorative element in bathrooms or kitchens  where it can be processed in either a modern or a more classical style  Floor finishing is best done with honed tiles  Sandstone With its natural cleft surface and variegated shades  this type of natural stone is particularly suitable for applications in rustic and rural surroundings  Some types are slightly more porous and therefore more suitable for the sunny side of the house

Prism_Chart_Example docx Cube_Examples docx LESSON CONTENTLesson Plan Template General Lesson Plan Learning Objectives  What should students know and be able to do as a result of this lesson By the end of this lesson  students should be able to describe that volume is a measurement of the amount of space inside a 3 dimensional figure  They should know that volume of a rectangular prism can be measured by finding the cubic units that would fit inside it  Students should be able to find the volume of a rectangular prism by counting the unit cubes  They will also be able to describe a rectangular prism as having length  width  and height and label these dimensions  This will build the foundation for later lessons in which they will use the formulas V   l x w x h and V   b x h  They will discuss the length  width  and height of a rectangular prism  so they will be able to use those dimensions to explain how the formula works  Prior Knowledge  What prior knowledge should students have for this lesson   Students should be able to recognize a rectangular prism and cube and be able to describe their attributes   Students should understand that area is a measurement of the number of square units that can cover a surface  Knowing area  they will understand the dimensions length and width   Students should know units of measurement such as centimeter  inch  and foot  Guiding Questions  What are the guiding questions for this lesson   What is area a measurement of   How can you find the area of a rectangle   review from previous grade level   What is volume a measurement of   What is a cubic unit   How can you find the volume of a rectangular prism or cube   How are area and volume related   What does area measure   What does volume measure   What are examples in real life of objects with area  with volume   What is a square unit  How does it differ from a cubic unit Teaching Phase  How will the teacher present the concept or skill to students   The teacher will show students the centimeter grid paper and discuss the dimensions of each square  Remind students of using a square unit to measure the area of a 2 dimensional  plane or flat  figure  Each side of the square centimeter has a length of 1 centimeter   The teacher will tell students that squares and rectangles are called 2 dimensional figures because they have 2 dimensions  length and width   The teacher will ask students   How do we find the area of a rectangle     Count the squares or Multiply length x width    The teacher will show students a centimeter popcube  or base ten unit  and ask them what is different between it and the centimeter square   It is 3 dimensional  It s not flat  It s a solid figure    The teacher will tell students that it is a 3 dimensional figure  It still has length and width but adds the dimension of height   Ask students   What does height measure   How tall something is    The teacher will draw a large cube or rectangular prism on the board or chart paper and label the length  width  and height   The teacher can review why a cube is a special type of rectangular prism which has 6 congruent faces  This is similar to the concept of the square being a special type of rectangle which has 4 equal sides   Ask students   How did we label our answer when we found the area of a rectangle or square   square units  such as square inches or centimeters    The teacher will tell students that we will begin working with volume today  Volume is the amount of same size cubes like the centimeter cube that will fill the space inside a rectangular prism or cube   The centimeter cube has faces that all have sides with a length of 1 centimeter  It has a length of 1 centimeter  a width of 1 centimeter  and a height of 1 centimeter  It can be used to find the volume in centimeters   The teacher will tell students that since it has these 3 dimensions  volume is labeled with cubic centimeters  or any other cubic unit    We can count the number of cubes to find the volume of a rectangular prism or cube   The teacher will model putting together standard popcubes  2 centimeters  or centimeter popcubes by first creating the first layer of a rectangular prism  For example  put together 6 cubes in a 3 by 2 layer   Ask students   How many cubes are there     6   The teacher will build a second layer of 6 cubes on top of the first layer  Ask students   How many cubes are there now     12   The teacher will build a third layer of 6 cubes on top of the first two layers  Ask students   How many cubes are in this rectangular prism   18   What is the volume   The volume is 18 cubic units or cubic centimeters  if using centimeter popcubes    Explain to students that they will have an opportunity to create a rectangular prism  or cube  with the popcubes and count the cubes to find the volume  Guided Practice  What activities or exercises will the students complete with teacher guidance   The teacher will distribute 20 popcubes to each student  Each student will create a rectangular prism or cube with all or some of the cubes   Have each student write the volume of their figure on an individual dry erase board or paper  Remind them to use cubic units   Have learning buddies or shoulder partners check each others answers  while the teacher circulates the room to also check for accuracy   At this time the teacher can make notes about who is struggling with counting the cubes  losing count or not counting all the cubes  and give corrective feedback  The teacher can also record any observations or strategies students use to ask them to share with the class   Bring students back together and ask students that found another way to find the volume besides counting every cube to share their strategies   For example    My volume was 15 cubic units  I added 5   5   5 to get 15    or   My volume was 8 cubic units  I made a layer of 2 on top of another layer of 2  so I had 2   2 or 2 x 2   4  I then stuck that with another layer of 4  so I did 4   4 or 4 x 2   8    The teacher will show students their model of the 18 cubes again and compare it to the visual drawn on the board or chart paper with the length  width  and height labeled   Take the layers of 6 apart so you can discuss the length  width  and height as you build each layer   The teacher will show the students one layer and turn it so it is a rectangle of 6 facing them   Ask   What is the length of this layer   3 units   Ask   What is the width of this layer  or rectangle    2 units   The Commutative Property can be used here if it has not been taught that the length is the longer side  So  students can say 2 units as the length and 3 units as the width   This layer is like area in which we have a length and a width but since these are 3 dimensional figures they also have a height   Ask students   What is the height of this layer     1 unit    Place the second layer on top and ask the same 3 questions about the length  width  and height   This time the height is 2 units but the length and width are the same    Place the third  last  layer back on the rectangular prism and ask the same 3 questions   This time the height is 3 units  The length is still 3 units and the width is still 2 units    Have students turn and talk to their shoulder partner learning buddy about the length  width  and height of their rectangular prisms   The teacher will listen to the students for accuracy and observe if any students are discussing multiplication  These students are ready for the next lesson which will use the formulas to find volume   Before sending students to work on Independent Practice  have a few students model their rectangular prism and talk about its length  width  height and volume  Independent Practice  What activities or exercises will students complete to reinforce the concepts and skills developed in the lesson   Give students access to more popcubes and several sticky notes   The teacher will explain to students that they will need to work with 12 popcubes at a time  This number can be adjusted higher or lower to accommodate student abilities and or the number of popcubes that are available   Tell students that again they will be creating rectangular prisms but each prism has to have the same volume of 12  or whatever number you choose  cubic units   Their job is to find as many different prisms with a volume of 12 cubic units as they can   On the sticky notes  they will attach the labels for length  width  and height   See Cube Examples for a model of 2 examples with 12 popcubes  Closure  How will the teacher assist students in organizing the knowledge gained in the lesson   The teacher will have students check that all their rectangular prisms have the same number of popcubes  thus having the same volume   Have students help create the Prism Chart as a class and or do it independently to organize their data  See the Prism Chart Example for a model   If students complete it independently  they do not have to fill out every row  only as many as they find   Teachers can collect the chart for a summative assessment   Keep the popcubes models so students have a gallery walk and see each others creations  Summative Assessment This is an introductory lesson to volume  The teacher will determine if the students have reached the learning target of finding volume by counting the unit cubes during Guided Practice  The students will complete an exit activity during Independent Practice that will indicate if they are ready to go on to the next lesson  standard MAFS 5  MD 3 5   during which they apply volume formulas  The exit activity will require students to build rectangular prisms  label the dimensions  and justify that each volume is correct  Formative Assessment As the students are finding the volume of their rectangular prisms  the teacher will be able to determine which strategy they are using   counting every cube or using repeated addition or multiplication to find shortcuts  Some students will only be able to find volume by counting every unit cube  Some students will be proficient with finding the number of cubic units using more efficient strategies  as well as labeling the length  width  and height of their rectangular prisms  This will help the teacher determine if students are ready for the next lesson in which they will apply the volume formulas  Students who are struggling with counting all the cubes will need more practice with adding a layer at a time and counting the cubes within each layer before putting the prism together  Feedback to Students While completing the Guided Practice  the students will explain how they found the volume of their rectangular prism to both the teacher and their learning buddy or shoulder partner  The teacher will be able to provide immediate feedback as they ask questions to find out more information about what the student did to find the volume  Students can use this feedback as they complete the Independent Practice  ACCOMMODATIONS   RECOMMENDATIONSAccommodations   Students who are having difficulty counting the popcubes  either missing cubes or losing count  can build the layers separately  They should count each individual layer before assembling the rectangular prism   Students can be given a different number of popcubes in both the Guided and Independent Practice to accommodate their abilities  either more or less    Students who need more of a challenge can create two non overlapping right rectangular prisms  composite figures  and add the volumes of the non overlapping parts  MAFS 5  MD 3 5c   Extensions   Students can create two non overlapping right rectangular prisms  composite figures  and add the volumes of the non overlapping parts  MAFS 5  MD 3 5c    Students can use the Cubes Applet from Illuminations to fill a box with cubes  rows  and layers and find the volume  They can adjust the length  referred to as depth   width  and height of the box  Suggested Technology  Document Camera  Computers for Students  Internet Connection  LCD Projector Special Materials Needed The teacher will need the following materials    Centimeter grid paper   Centimeter cubes or base ten units   Popcubes  2 cm  or cm   enough so that every student will have at least 20  but preferably 100    Chart paper and markers   Sticky notes  any size  but the smaller  the better Further Recommendations If you would like students to use the Cubes Applet from Illuminations  have the website ready on the computers for them to go to when they complete their work  It can also be used as a modification for students having difficulty building the rectangular prisms or counting accurately to find the volume  SOURCE AND ACCESS INFORMATIONContributed by  Susanna

D2713182	The Economic factors affecting business environment	The Economic factors affecting business environment Article shared by Business  now a days is vitally affected by the economic  social  legal  technological and political factors  These factors collectively form business environment  Business environment  as such  is the total of all external forces  which affect the organisation and operations of business  The environment of an organisation has got internal  operational and general lives managers must be aware of these three environmental levels and their relationship and importance  Image Source  publishyourarticles net wp content uploads 2015 06 businessplan 1024 361 jpg The term  business environment implies those external forces  factors and institutions that are beyond the control of individual business organisations and their management and affect the business enterprise  It implies all external forces within which a business enterprise operates  Business environment influence the functioning of the business system  Thus  business environment may be defined as all those conditions and forces which are external to the business and are beyond the individual business unit  but it operates within it  These forces are customer  creditors  competitors  government  socio cultural organisations  political parties national and international organisations etc  some of those forces affect the business directly which some others have indirect effect on the business  Business environment as such are classified into the following three major categories  they are Internal environment Operational environment General external environment ADVERTISEMENTS Both internal and operational environment are the creation of the enterprise itself  The factors of external or general environment are broad in scope and least controlled and influenced by the management of the enterprises  Now we discuss those factors in details as below Economic dimensions of environment Economic environment refers to the aggregate of the nature of economic system of the country  the structural anatomy of the economy to economic policies of the government the organisation of the capital market  the nature of factor endowment  business cycles  the socio economic infrastructure etc  The successful businessman visualizes the external factors affecting the business  anticipating the prospective market situations and makes suitable to get the maximum with minimize cost  Social dimensions or environment The social dimension or environment of a nation determines the value system of the society which  in turn affects the functioning of the business  Sociological factors such as costs structure  customs and conventions  cultural heritage  view toward wealth and income and scientific methods  respect for seniority  mobility of labour etc  have far reaching impact on the business  These factors determines the work culture and mobility of labour  work groups etc  For instance  the nature of goods and services to be produced depends upon the demand of the people which in turn is affected by their attitudes  customs  so as cultural values fashion etc  Socio cultural environment determines the code of conduct the business should follow  The social groups such as trade unions or consumer forum will intervene if the business follows the unethical practices  For instance  if the firm is not paying fair wages to its business in indulging in black marketing or adulteration  consumers forums and various government agencies will take action against the business  ADVERTISEMENTS Political environment The political environment of a country is influenced by the political organisations such as philosophy of political parties  ideology of government or party in power  nature and extent of bureaucracy influence of primary groups etc  political stability in the country  foreign policy  Defence and military policy  image of the country and its leaders in and outside the country  The political environment of the country influences the business to a great extent  For instance  the Government of India  bottling and sale of cocoa cola was discontinued in India in the late seventies following policy of restricting the growth of multinationals in Indian markets  But  its entry was allowed under the New Industrial policy of 1991  Under this new policy  government allowed liberalized licensing  imports and exports  inflow of foreign capital and technology on more liberal terms  The trend towards globalization and signing of GATT in 1993 have posed new challenges before Indian business  Legal regulatory environment Legal environment includes flexibility and adaptability of law and other legal rules governing the business  It may include the exact rulings and decision of the courts  These affect the business and its managers to a great extent  For instance  in 1992  the Supreme Court ordered the closure of a number of tanneries in Kanpur as they were polluting Holi Ganga  In August 1993 several foundries around the famous Taj Mahal were ordered to be closed down because of air pollution caused by them had adverse impact on the whiteness of Taj Mahal  Technical environment The business in a country is greatly influenced by the technological development  The technology adopted by the industries determines the type and quality of goods and services to be produced and the type and quality of plant and equipment to be used  Technological environment influences the business in terms of investment in technology

D2089371	Inquiry Science	Inquiry Science Scientific Inquiry sounds complex  too complex for young students  It makes us think of intricate instruments and computer simulations  pages of data  and long  involved mathematical equations  Scientific Inquiry can involve all of those things  but at its root scientific inquiry is the way that scientists see the natural world  Scientific inquiry is the collection of qualitative and quantitative data and the use of that data to explain how the natural world works  Scientific Inquiry  far from being foreign to children  is the way children naturally learn   they play and experiment  they see what happens  and from these experiences they build their own rules and expectations about how the world works  Science Skills Click a module icon below to view some Science Skills demos  Science Tools Learn More About Science Skills The Inquiry book at Science4Us consists of two units  Science Tools and Think Like a Scientist  Each unit takes a student s natural desire to play and experiment and begins to show how observations can be noted and analyzed  building skills for using the scientific method  The Tools module introduces students to the tools scientists use for both qualitative and quantitative observations  Students learn to use tools such as their senses  rulers  and balance scales through hands on activities  They play online games in which they choose tools  estimate sizes and quantities  and compare measurements  Measurement activities allow students to meet math standards while learning to collect and compare data in the way that scientists do  The Think Like a Scientist module helps students understand that there are different ways to solve problems  Students learn about and revisit ways to represent observations and information and compare the use and effectiveness of maps  compare contrast  models  and graphic organizers in presenting and evaluating data  In addition  students build both math and science skills as they work with graphs  tables  charts  and labeled instructions  Language skills come into play as students recognize and describe relationships between things they are studying using analogies  cause and effect  and chronological order  Inquiry allows students to learn at their own level skills that scientists use every day  Learning these skills at a young age will help students to participate in science experiments  prepare for science fairs  and observe the world around them  As they grow  students will build on the foundation they have built in their K 2 years
D868869	Ventral Surface	 Free Books   Medicine   Health   Anatomy Of Human Skeleton  Ventral Surface Description This section is from the book    The Anatomy Of The Human Skeleton     by J  Ernest Frazer  Also available from Amazon  The anatomy of the human skeleton  Ventral Surface Observe that the narrow rim on this surface close to the vertebral border  for the Serratus magnus  widens at the upper and lower angles especially at the lower angle   and thus the origin of Subscapularis cannot reach these or the intervening border  These widenings correspond with the arrangement of the digitations of the muscle   the upper two are inserted into the upper angle  the next two into the border  and the remaining ones converge on the lower angle  The arrangement indicates that the main action of the muscle is on the lower angle  and such action is illustrated in the movement of raising the hand over the head  The arm is abducted by the fibres of the Deltoid acting from the outer margins of the acromion  and the effect of the contraction of this muscle is to approximate its points of attachment either by raising the arm or by rotating the scapula inwards on its upper attachments  Fig  60   Naturally the latter movement would occur rather than the lifting of the heavy limb  if it were not for the Serratus magnus  which  pulling forward on the angle of the scapula  would tend to rotate that bone outwards and thus to neutralise the action of the Deltoid on the bone Thus the Serratus can be said to h  the scapula while the Deltoid raises the arm to a right angle   after this  since the humerus cannot be further abducted from the scapula owing to the conformation of the tissues  the Deltoid fixes the humerus on the scapula while the Serratus magnus  by its active contractions  rotates the scapula outwards and thus raises the arm higher   the Trapezius is associated with Serratus magnus in these actions  whereas the Rhomboids have the opposite effect when they contract  Such action of the Serratus magnus on the scapula is best served by concentrating its force on the lower angle  as far as possible from the axis of rotation  and this calls for a modification in the structure of the scapula  It is evident that  with a weight tending to turn the glenoid cavity down on the one hand and a strong muscle pulling the angle forward and thus turning the glenoid up on the other hand  the bone requires strengthening in the line between the angle and the glenoid  for here is where it would   buckle   at once if it lacked resisting power  Consequently we find a very thick bar of bone in this line of greatest strain  more apparent on the ventral side owing to its concavity  but also visible dorsally where it is covered by the Teres muscles  This thick ventral bar  then  is a   primary    ridge  concerned in the mechanical  building of the bone  and has nothing to do with the axillary border  which is a secondary ridge carried out on its outer aspect  The covering of Subscapularis is really responsible for the axillary border as a ridge  and so we find that the origin of this muscle extends out to the axillary border  and follows this even when  as frequently occurs  it turns on to the dorsal surface for a little distance between the Teres major and minor  Fig  57   The line of origin of Subscapularis extends along the border as far up as the origin of the Triceps  Its inner limit is made by the area for Serratus magnus  as already mentioned  and its margin reaches the top border of the bone in front of the upper and inner angle  and runs along this border as far as the suprascapular notch  The outer limit of its origin between this point and the axillary border is somewhat variable   the muscle marking given in the figure may be taken as an average type  and the concave irregular line passes inside the foramina found in the ventral fossa  which are for small vessels belonging to the suprascapular system  Observe now that the area of origin is marked by a variable number of secondary ridges  all converging in the direction of the fibres of the muscle   these are evidently for intramuscular tendinous slips  which increase the area of origin of the muscle so that it forms an exceedingly thick mass  If the bones are articulated and a line drawn to represent the lower border of the muscle  from the lowest point of its origin to the lowest point of insertion  it is evident that its inferior border comes down a considerable distance below the axillary margin of the scapula  as shown in the figures  The outer third of the ventral surface is covered by the Subscapularis  which plays over it without arising from it  As it gets near the neck the subscapular bursa separates it from the bone  and the coracoid process arches forward over the top of its tendon   the subscapular bursa is frequently prolonged upwards over the tendon as a    sub coracoid bursa    between it and the concave lower aspect of the coracoid process under which it plays  The subscapular bursa is also between the tendon and the inner part of the capsule  and opens into the joint between the upper and middle gleno humeral ligaments  by a large aperture on and in which the upper part of the tendon lies as it passes out towards the humerus  Dorsal Surface  see Fig  57   Notice that the floors of the supra  and infra  spinous fossae are in different planes  depending on the relations of their contained muscles to the rounded end of the humerus  It is this difference in planes that really makes the subscapular hollow on the bone  for this hollow corresponds with the base of the spine  where the two planes meet at an angle  130 degrees  with each other as well as with the spine  It can be seen that the bone below the level of the spine is slightly concave  that is  it is shghtly convex on the ventral side  and in the early embryonic condition the scapula is decidedly convex on its ventral aspect  and does not possess a supraspinous fossa   the Supraspinatus is at first a very small rudiment attached only to the upper and outer border of the bone  and as it extends it forms a fossa  and this in its turn makes an angle with the lower plate which is the subscapular hollow  see Fig  58   The two muscles that occupy the fossae extend their origin to the vertebral border   here there is a definite rim which marks the attachment of their covering aponeuroses  Supraspinatus arises along the upper margin and in the fossa as far as the level of the notch  where the suprascapular vessels and nerve pass between it and the bone  turning slightly forward to reach the great scapular notch  Both muscles get an origin from the spine of variable length  but usually extending outwards as a narrow area considerably further than their origins from the floors of the fossae  The presence of intramuscular tendons in the Infraspinatus is shown by the ridges on the bony surface  The aponeurosis covering Infraspinatus is strong  giving origin to muscular fibres and making by its outer attachment the line separating the infraspinous and teres surfaces   therefore the origin of Infraspinatus reaches this hne  and extends up along it for a considerable distance  The two Teres muscles lie against the aponeurosis on this line  and the Teres major in particular is very prone to extend its area of origin on to the aponeurosis  thus lying partly superficial to Infraspinatus  Origin of Teres minor extends to the neck of the bone  its area being interrupted by the passage of the dorsalis scapulae vessels   these lie in a definite groove on the bone  and are covered by a fibrous arch from which muscle fibres arise  At the inner end of the groove there is a break in the ridge for the infraspinous aponeurosis  showing where the vessels pierce the aponeurosis to pass deep to the Infraspinatus  and this point can be used as the upper limit of origin of the outer border of Infraspinatus  Fig  57  Left scapula   1  from behind   2  from the front  3  from above   4  glenoid region   5  scheme to show relations of capsule of shoulder joint  A  dark green   line of junction of coracoid and scapular parts  fi  light green   glenoid ligament round cavity  C  fibrous band under Subscapularis  across branch of subscapular artery into subscapular fossa  D D  ridges marking tendons of origin of Deltoid  see Fig  59   E  occasional bursa under Trapezius  By articulating the bones it can be seen that the lower border of Teres minor comes down below the level of the axillary border of the bone  as in the case of Subscapularis  and almost to the same extent  In other words  the two muscles are only partly separated by the bone  and below this  from within outwards  by dorsalis scapulae artery  long head of Triceps  and finally by the upper end of the humerus  Teres major is a part of the Subscapular mass which has extended round the border of the bone to reach its dorsal surface  but  being part of that mass  it must lie in the same general plane that is  it lies along the lower border of Subscapularis and passes with it in front of Triceps  instead of behind the plane of this muscle which would be the level of muscles belonging properly to the dorsal musculature of the scapula  It is not separated from its main mass as a result of its dorsal origin or the passage of nerves and vessels between them  but owing to its difference in function   this is the great cause of separation between muscles belonging to the same mass fundamentally  The spino glenoid ligament  which bridges over the great scapular notch  is simply a fascial band made by the fusion of the fascial sheaths of Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus   these coverings are at first separated by the spine  but they come together at the free edge of this process  and are attached to this edge and to the capsule  etc   further out  The fused sheaths thus form a    ligament    with these connections  and this must of course be over the vessels and nerve here  because they are deep to the plane of the muscles and fasciae concerned  Continue to prev  Scapula Table of Contentsnext

D917779	How to write a cover letter	 On this page The purpose of a cover letter How long should a cover letter be Matching your cover letter to the job What you should include in your cover letter What you shouldn t include in your cover letter Writing a cover letter when there s no job advertised Email cover letters What to do when only a cover letter is asked for Cover letter templates A cover letter is a single page letter that should be part of any job application  The only time a cover letter shouldn t be included is when a job ad clearly says not to include one  At all other times you should include a cover letter  The purpose of a cover letter A cover letter needs to introduce youmention the job  or kind of job  you re applying for  or looking for match your skills and experiences with the skills and experiences required by the jobencourage the reader to read your resumefinish with a call to action  for example  requesting an interview or asking to meet   For more about each of these steps  check out   What to include on your cover letter   section on this page  How long should a cover letter be A cover letter shouldn t be more than one page  It s only meant to be a summary of the information you put in your resume  so remember to keep things short  Matching your cover letter to the job You should never use the same cover letter for different job applications  Your cover letter needs to show that you know what the job involves and what the organisation is looking for  To do this you need to be as specific as you can about your skills and qualities and how they match the job or organisation s needs  Here are three simple ways to make your cover letter as specific as possible 1  Find out who to address it to Try not to address your letter   To Whom It May Concern   if you can  Finding out who to address your application to takes a little bit of effort  but it s worth it  If you found the job in an ad  the ad will probably name a person to send the application to  If not  contact the employer or advertiser and ask who to send the application to  It s best to call if you can  but you can also email them if you don t have a contact phone number for them  If you manage to find out the person s name  don t use their first name  Use either   Mr    or   Ms    and their last name instead 2  Find out more about the job When finding out who to address your application to  you could also try to contact that person so you can ask questions that can help you match your cover letter  and resume  to the job  Questions you could ask include Does the job involve working as part of a team Who would I be reporting to if I got the job Can you tell me more about the kind of people you re looking for Is there a position description I can look at  only ask this if the job ad didn t mention a position description  The answers to these questions can give you some ideas for things to mention in your cover letter 3  Find out more about the company Finding out more about a company is another good way to work out how to tailor your cover letter  Here are some tips If you know the name of the company  look for information online  If the company has a website  visit it  especially their About Us page   If the company name isn t in the ad  call the recruitment agency or advertiser and ask who the employer is  What you should include in your cover letter Here s a list of things you should include in your cover letter  For examples of how to include these things  visit our Sample cover letters page  Your name and contact details Put your name and contact details at the top of your cover letter  You don t have to give your postal address  but you do need to include your email and phone number  Make sure you ll be able to answer the number you give  Don t give your landline number if you re not going to be home to answer it  Your email address should create a professional impression  Don t use an email address like yolo zapbangpowdude co uk   If you don t have a professional email address  you can make one with a free email provider  Make it simple   something like your first name and your last name is a good way to go  Their name and contact details Under your own name and contact details you should include the name of the person you re writing totheir position or the name of their companytheir contact details  If you re having trouble finding this information you can call the company to ask who you should address your application to  You can also use   To Whom It May Concern    but try to only use this as a last resort  The name of the job you re going for At the start of your cover letter you need to explain which job you re applying for  You can either do this on a line by itself  for example    Re  Application for Stock Controller position    or in the opening paragraph  for example    I am writing to apply for the recently advertised Stock Controller position    For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  A list of your relevant skills Your letter should include a brief summary that matches your skills and experiences to the job description  A short bullet pointed list is fine  If you re answering a job ad  either the ad or the position description may provide a list of skills and experiences that are essential for doing the job  It may also provide a list of   desirable   skills and experience  Your cover letter needs to respond to all of the items on the   essential   list and as many items as possible on the   desirable   list in as short a way as possible  Remember that if you say you have a skill or experience  you need to show how you ve used it or how you got it  for example  if you say you ve got child minding skills  mention some jobs where you ve used them   For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  A summary of why you re right for the job After listing your skills and experience you should explain why these mean you re suited to the job  for example    The combination of my interest in AFL and my experience with book keeping makes me ideally suited for this job    For examples of how to do this  visit our Sample cover letters page  Speak their language Using the same language as people who do a particular job is a good way to convince people you re suited to the job  Getting familiar with what a company does and how it talks about itself can give you ideas about things to mention in your cover letter  and how to talk about them  For example  if there s a tool or software or skill the job requires  like machining tools or cash handling  mention it in your cover letter  but make sure you mention it correctly    Read the   Matching your cover letter to the job   section on this page for tips on finding out more about a company  Ask them to read your resume   contact you Your cover letter should finish by asking the reader to read your resume  It should also ask them to contact you about an interview  Try something simple like    I have attached a copy of my resume  I look forward to hearing from you about this job   For more examples of ways to finish a cover letter  visit our Sample cover letters page  What you shouldn t include in your cover letter Just as important as the things you should include on your cover letter are the things that should never be on your cover letter  Here are some things to watch out for  Typos or mistakes Always spellcheck your cover letter  It s even better to get someone else to read it and point out any mistakes or confusing things  People you could ask to read over your cover letter include friends  family members  your careers teacher or a careers counsellor at your university or TAFE  Double check everything in your cover letter  If you mention a company s name  make sure you get it right  If you mention places you ve worked before  make sure you get their names right too  Mistakes on cover letters are worse than typos  Including your whole resume Don t cut and paste your resume into your cover letter  Try to re word the information on your resume rather than just repeating it  Keep your cover letter short and let your resume tell the whole story  Using   I   too much Try to make sure that you don t fill your cover letter with things like   I believe      I have   and   I am    Once you ve written your letter  read over it and try to take out or rewrite as many sentences that start with   I   as you can  Don t mention your other job applications You ll probably have more than one job application on the go at any one time  It s important  though  not to mention other job applications  You re trying to convince people you really want the job  It s hard to do that if they know you re looking for other jobs as well  Even though most people assume you re applying for more than one job at a time  it s a good idea not to act like you are  Writing a cover letter when there s no job advertised Sometimes you might want to work for a particular business or organisation even though there haven t been any jobs advertised with them  This is often called   cold calling    Contacting a business directly to ask if there are any jobs available can show that you re motivated and enthusiastic  It could even get you a job  Even if there s no job currently available  there s a chance the business could keep your details on file and get in touch when a job does become available  A cold calling cover letter can be written like any other cover letter  with just a few differences  It should show you ve researched the organisation or business and know about what it doesmention why you re interested in working for them  in terms of what they do and your own long term goals show how your skills  experience and interest fit in with the goals of the business or organisationlet them know what you re hoping for  for example  you might want to know about positions currently available or speak to someone about what it s like to work there finish the letter by saying that you ll contact them again soon  but that you re happy to talk to them if they want to contact you before that  If you haven t heard back in a couple of weeks  it s okay to contact them again to ask for a response  You could try emailing them or calling them to discuss your letter directly  Our Cold calling cover letter template is an example of this kind of cover letter  For more information about approaching organisations and businesses directly  visit our Cold calling   What is it  page  Email cover letters Sometimes you ll be asked to send your cover letter as an email instead of a separate document  If this happens you should write your name and the job title in the email subject line  for example     Jayani Lal   Application for Administration Assistant role   remember you still need to use the name of the person you re writing toavoid formatting the body of the email like a letter   leave out the contact details and just go straight to the   Dear XXXX   part end the email with a professional signature that includes your phone numberalways send the email from a professional email address  For more about email cover letters  visit our Sample cover letters page and choose the email cover letter template that matches your level of experience  What to do when only a cover letter is asked for Some organisations may specifically ask you to respond to requirements of the job in a one page cover letter instead of submitting a resume  When this happens it s important to link your experience to the job s requirements in your cover letter  When writing this kind of cover letter you should include contact details  yours and theirs   a reference line and a brief introduction to yourself  as advised in   What to include in your cover letter    section on this page briefly summarise your experienceuse bullet points to clearly outline each requirement and how you meet itconclude by asking them to contact you  as advised in   What to include in your cover letter   on this page  For more about this kind of cover letter  visit our Sample cover letters

D1033060	Dog Fleas vs Cat Fleas	Dogs   Flea and Ticks Dog Fleas vs Cat Fleas Dog fleas are different from cat fleas or other types of fleas for that matter  as fleas are species specific  This means that the fleas that are found on your dog cannot harm your cat  However  the feline fleas have adapted to be able to live on canine blood as well  Presently  most dogs suffering from fleas have feline fleas  Cat Fleas The Ctenocephalides felis is the name of the cat fleas  These fleas are powerful parasites that are typically found on felines  but may also be found on canines  The cat fleas may also bite humans  but may not live on humans  The cat fleas produce eggs  which hatch into larvae and will result in new fleas  The cat fleas develop at an alarming rate and live for up to 1 year  provided they have blood to feed on and if they are not treated with insecticides  The adult female lays up to 20 eggs per day  The cat fleas are brown and the eggs are white  resembling cat dander  The cat fleas may be visible if the pet has a white colored coat  The fleas also leave dry blood behind  which can also be identified on the pet s coat  The fleas have developed resistance to many insecticides  but there are still some flea solutions that can work  Also  bleach is ideal to remove the fleas  the eggs and the larvae from the environment of an infested cat or dog  The cat fleas may transmit various diseases such as the typhus or the Bartonella  If ingested  fleas can cause the formation of tapeworms  Dog Fleas The dog fleas are also known as the Ctenocephalides canis and are very rare in the US  but spread in Europe  Most cases of fleas on dogs reported  i e  over 95   were found to be cat fleas  This is due to the fact that the cat fleas have adapted to be able to live on dogs as well  However  the dog fleas may not bite cats  as they haven t adapted to live on feline blood  The female dog fleas produce 4000 eggs during a life cycle  Dog fleas can bite humans  but they cannot live on humans  Dog Fleas vs Cat Fleas There are numerous types of fleas including human fleas  but they are all species specific  The fleas on your dog will not bite the cat  but the cat may be a host for a while  until the flea finds a canine and will feed on his blood  The canine fleas are very rare  However  the fleas that are found on cats may be transmitted to dogs  as these fleas have adapted so that they can feed on canine blood as well  The dog fleas and the cat fleas are similar in morphology and cannot be differentiated with the naked eye  A microscope can help tell the difference between the cat and dog fleas  Both cat and dog fleas may bite humans  but cannot infest the humans with fleas  Comments Related Links Array
D3169072	Corpuscular Theory of Light	Physics Corpuscular Theory of Light Asif Shaik Corpuscular Theory Definition The corpuscular theory states that light is made up of tiny particles called  corpuscles   little particles  that always travel in a straight line  What is Corpuscular Theory Light is a form of energy that travels from one place to another place at high velocity  Various scientists have attempted to explain the nature of light  However  the first scientific attempt to explain the nature of light was made by Sir Isaac Newton  In the 17 th century  two different theories about the nature of light were proposed  these theories were the  wave theory  and  corpuscular theory   The  Corpuscular theory of light was proposed by Newton in 1704  In this theory  he successfully explained the nature of light  The corpuscular theory is the simplest theory of light in which light is assumed as the tiny particles called  corpuscles   The corpuscular theory is often referred to as particle theory or Newton s theory of light  Newton s Corpuscular Theory Statement According to the Newton s corpuscular theory Light is made up of tiny particles called  corpuscles  having negligible mass  These particles  corpuscles  are perfectly elastic  The corpuscles are emitted from the luminous sources such as Sun  candle  electric lamp etc  The tiny particles  corpuscles  always travel in a straight line in all directions  Each particle  corpuscle  carries kinetic energy with it while moving  The corpuscles travel at high velocity  The corpuscles  light  would travel faster in the denser medium than in rarer medium  But later this is proved wrong  We know that light travels faster in the rarer medium than in denser medium  When the particles  corpuscles  fall on the retina of the eye  they produce an image of the object or sensation of vision  The corpuscles can be of different sizes  The different colors of light are due to the different sizes of the corpuscles  Corpuscular theory example The corpuscular theory could be easily understood with a simple example  Take a rubber ball  Stand before a wall  Throw the ball in such a way that it hits the wall normally  You will observe that the ball bounces and returns along the same path  Now  throw the ball in such a way that it makes a certain angle with the surface of the wall  You will observe that the ball bounces and goes away from the surface of the wall making an equal angle with respect to the normal drawn at the point of incidence  These observations show that the rubber ball obeys the laws of reflection  Just like the rubber ball  when corpuscles hit the surface they are reflected back in the same path or reflect at an equal angle with respect to the normal drawn at the point of incidence  The corpuscles of light behave like the rubber balls  Corpuscular theory about reflection of light The corpuscular theory explains the reflection of light in exactly the same way as the reflection of a perfectly elastic ball from a rigid plane  When the corpuscles  particles  hit the reflecting surface  they are reflected from it in such a way that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection  This is due to the repulsion between the corpuscles and the reflecting surface  Corpuscular theory about refraction of light According to Newton  when corpuscles  light particles  approach the refracting surface  they are attracted near the surface  When they enter the denser medium from a rarer medium  their speed increases and hence change their direction  Failures of Newton s corpuscular theory Newton assumed that light travels faster in the denser medium than in the rarer medium which has been proved wrong  The assumption that the different colors of light are due to the differences in the sizes of corpuscles has no justification  Newton assumed that reflection of light is due to the repulsion between the corpuscles and reflecting surface while refraction of light is due to the attraction between the corpuscles and refracting surface  Thus  a medium could either attract or repel the corpuscles of light  But later this statement was proved wrong  We all know that glass partially reflects and partially refracts light  How could then glass attract and repel the corpuscles of light simultaneously  Corpuscular theory cannot explain the phenomena of diffraction  interference  and polarization of light  Related Posts Mars Orbiter Mission Explained LIDAR  Light Detection And Ranging Solar Panels   How Solar Panels Work Photoelectric effect Fiber optic splitter Lightning   How Lightning Works Absorption of radiation  Spontaneous emission and SONAR or Sound Navigation and Ranging Magnetic Train

D842083	 	 So  where is the main house from    Weeds     Nancy Botwin s family home You ll find it at 26885 Chaucer Place  in Stevenson Ranch  CA  Stevenson Ranch is a master planned community in the Santa Clarita area  about 2 miles southwest of Six Flags Magic Mountain  and about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles   The neighborhood was also seen in the 1998 movie    Pleasantville     Here is an aerial photo of the house  Here is a map link  And here is a Google Street View panorama of the house  Warning   This is a private home   Do not trespass on their property  knock on their door  or do anything else that might disturb the residents Now lets examine the opening credits   scene by scene    The first thing we see is an aerial map of the Weeds suburb  which then morphs into an aerial photo of the same area  What we see is the map of a very real suburb  But ironically  it s not the same suburb where you ll find Nancy s house  This is actually the city of Calabasas   California    about 20 miles southwest of Stevenson Ranch To be more precise  the widest street  at the top  is Parkway Calabasas   while the looping  U shaped street that surrounds the neighborhood is Paseo Primario  Here s an actual aerial map of that suburb  Next  we see the entrance to the fictional community of Agrestic  featuring a sign and fountain  The name may be fake  but that sign fountain is very real  You ll find it at the west northwest corner of Stevenson Ranch Parkway   Holmes Place  at Stevenson Ranch  CA    Yes  we re back to the neighborhood with Nancy s home  These opening credits mix scenes from both Stevenson Ranch and Calabasas   And as you might expect  the sign really reads   Stevenson Ranch    not   Agrestic    Here is an aerial photo of the fountain sign  Here is a map view  And here is a matching Google Street View panorama  Next  we see a shot of guys jogging in a park   with houses up on a hill behind them  That shot was filmed in Rioux Memorial Park  near the center of the Stevenson Ranch neighborhood   It s west of that Agrestic sign  and east of Nancy s house  The full official name is Dr  Richard H  Rioux Memorial Park  and the street address is 26233 Faulkner Drive   Stevenson Ranch   CA  The doctor ran the two largest drug   alcohol rehabilitation centers in the Antelope Valley  which  given the plot of this show  seems appropriate  I believe the houses we see up on the hill are at the northeast end of Clifton Place  which means the camera is looking west northwest  Here is an aerial photo of the park  And here s a map link  Next  we look down on a suburban street   where the houses have red tile roofs  This is the intersection of Kavenaugh Lane   Singer Place   in Stevenson Ranch The camera is looking northeast up Singer Place   That shot is quickly followed by a similar view  which   not surprisingly   was shot just northeast of the first one  at the intersection of the same Singer Place   Hawes Way  Here is an aerial photo of both locations  And here s a Google Street View panorama matching that first shot  Next  we see a line of coffee drinking executives coming out of the    It s a Grind Coffee House     Now  there are several actual   It s a Grind  s out there  but don t bother Googling the name  because this isn t one of them  This is actually a Starbucks   located at 26531 Agoura Road   in Calabasas  It s in a small shopping center named Creekside Village   just south of the Ventura Freeway  at Las Virgenes   Agoura Roads  That s about 2 1 2 miles west of that suburb shown in that opening map   I think the camera is looking southwest  at the northeast side of the shop  Here s an aerial photo of the shop  And here s a map link  Next  we see another aerial shot of a suburb  with a string of black mini vansconverging on a semi circular street  like so many ants  But this time the houses are a little fancier than the ones we ve seen before  Not surprisingly  they didn t shoot this one at Stevenson Ranch   but they didn t shoot it in that map suburb either  Instead  they shot it at yet another location in Calabasas   that semi circular street is Mont Calabasas Drive  and the smaller street  feeding it a mini van  is Provence Drive   The camera appears to be looking south southwest  It s about a mile north of the coffee shop  and about four miles northwest of that original map suburb  Here s an aerial photo of that intersection  And here s a map link  Finally  we see several female joggers running on a suburban street  This was shot in the same neighborhood as the mini van shot  In fact  it s on the same main street  Mont Calabasas Drive  but this time it s about 250 yards farther south  at Lyon Court   The camera is again looking southwest  Here is an aerial photo  And here is a map link    Locations marked by an asterisk     may be located in areas with high crime rates  Exercise reasonable caution

D1984557	What can we learn from Hamlet s soliloquies 	 Homework Help   Hamlet What can we learn from Hamlet s soliloquies print Print document PDF list Cite Expert Answerssusan3smith   Certified Educator For starters  we learn what Hamlet thinks about himself  life  death  Denmark  his mother  Claudius  From his first soliloquy    O that this too too sullied flesh should melt    we learn that he is close to suicide over his father s death and his mother s too soon marriage to Claudius  We know that he is learned  scholarly  moral  and deeply disillusioned by those around him  But we also learn that he is not quick to action  He knows he must hold his tongue  Later  in Act 2  Hamlet reveals in his   O  what a rogue and peasant slave am I   soliloquy his extreme frustration over his inability to avenge his father s death  He is angry that Claudius lives and that he has been able to do nothing but put on an antic disposition  But in this soliloquy  filled with self loathing and bitterness  we see a very smart mind at work  He comes up with a clever plan to ascertain Claudius  guilt  In his   To be  or not to be   speech  we see further a more mature mind as Hamlet philosophically and rationally considers why people endure suffering in this life when they could take action to end this suffering  This speech marks a certain development in Hamlet s character in that it is a general musing rather than an individual expression of emotion  In Act 4  Hamlet s soliloquy   How all occasions do inform against me    we see Hamlet dissect the connection between thought  action  and cowardice as he evaluates the honor and merit of Fortinbras s actions  These are some of the major soliloquies and some brief ideas of what is learned through them  Through them we understand Hamlet s developing maturity throughout the play  his impressive thought processes  and his motivation for acting or refraining from acting  Much more could be written on these list Cite link Linkkapokkid   Certified Educator Not to beat a dead horse  but yes  thousands of pages could be and have been written about the soliloquies  One of the things that previous posters have not pointed out is the fact that you can learn a great deal about the skillful use of the English language from Hamlet s soliloquies  If we look at Hamlet s soliloquy in Act I  scene ii  the two sentences are themselves a wonderful demonstration of Shakespeare s ability and also happens to show us a great deal about Hamlet and about his state of mind  O that this too too sullied flesh would melt Thaw  and resolve itself into a dew Or that the Everlasting had not fixed His canon  gainst self slaughter  O God  God How weary  stale  flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world We learn here that it isn t just that he suspects some foul play in his father s death  it isn t just that things with Ophelia might not be going the way he hoped  but that everything    all the uses of this world   are empty and meaningless to him  He cannot even find a purpose in avenging his father  Here Shakespeare helps to show the depth of his characters  Unlike Romeo  who is carried away completely by his love of Juliet  Hamlet is far more introspective and far more deeply affected by the various things around him  This soliloquy serves to demonstrate some of that while also providing great examples of the use of imagery and symbolism  etc list Cite link Link Doug Stuva   Certified Educator The above answer does an excellent job of summarizing the main thrust of each of Hamlet s major soliloquies  and the editor is certainly correct when she writes that more could be written on them  In fact  a thousand pages could easily be written to answer your question  I ll just elaborate on one line from one soliloquy to give you some specifics  In Hamlet s early speech in which he figuratively wishes his flesh  his life  would melt away  he metaphorically compares the world  existence  to   an unweeded garden    Hamlet here is applying his own personal situation to the world and existence as a whole  projecting his own troubles on to existence  This is evidence that he is suffering from melancholy  or as we would say today  major depression  His father s unexpected death and his mother s hasty and incestuous remarriage apparently triggered Hamlet s depression before the opening of the play  And one common symptom of depression is  of course  inaction  If everything is meaningless and hopeless  why bother list Cite link Link
D1570373	Is war justified for any reasons 	Yes ofcourse it is There is always a reason a war is started  there are a wide variety of reasons  e  G religion  money  power  pure hatred  that can relate to each war that has erupted  In the country s best interest  why would a war start for absolutely no reason  There will always be a gain if won  which is the justified reason for a war Posted by  Blondie21 Report Post Reply Challenge3War can be justified when there is a humanitarian crisis  Going to war entails a lot of casualties and damage to properties  but if it means saving people against genocide and other atrocities  it is necessary  A country may not be involved in other country s affairs within its jurisdiction  but when it genocides its own people  I believe that other countries should intervene now  Sovereignty does not excuse a country to kill its own people without intervention  Saving the humanity is a reason to go to war even if it involves sacrifices  we cannot just do nothing  Posted by  Juris Report Post Reply Challenge0All wars are justifiable  few are justified  Any war can be justifiable  Justifiable no man would ever take the risks that war encumbers without reason  The real question is whether or not the given reason is moral  What  therefore  would make a war moral  or immoral  Are morals absolute  or are they up to individuals  Should morals be based on feelings  religion  or other reasons  Do ends justify means  These are the true questions that must be answered before the question of justified war can be answered  and unfortunately each point is complicated and has been individually debated for as long as human history  I will therefor give my own opinion without reasoning  as the reasoning itself would take several drawn out conversations  or books to even begin to express  Yes  there are absolute morals  These morals stem from a literal translation of original canon of the Christian Bible  this includes the Torah  Nevi im  Ketuvim  Gospels  Epistles  and the book of Revelation   Finally  no  the ends never justify the means  Based on these presumptions I believe that war can  and should always be fought if other criteria are met  First it should be in the protection of others  this may include your own citizens   never for personal gain or interest  Second  these others must want your help  Third  without compromising the first two conditions  you must do everything in your power to resolve a conflict peacefully  All three conditions must be met for a war to be justified  but if even one is not met  the war can never be justified  If there are any arguments or problems with the assertions I have made please do reply debate is a great and glorious thing if used with the desire to find truth  P  S  It should be noted that my unwillingness to explain my beliefs in further detail a major cop out  and one that I hope to address in some way  Mabey I will write several books if I must  but just be aware that I do have very sound reasoning  and careful consideration that has led to my beliefs as they are  Report Post Reply0Is war ever justified  Yes  yes it is I think war can be justified  Take for example World War 2  Could anyone with a clean conscience just sit and watch while Hitler took over the world  No  Take another example  North Korea  If they try to bomb us  will we just let them murder us all  No  We fight back and defend ourselves  even if it causes a war  Report Post Reply0Yes  you can t just do nothing  You see  when it comes to war  everyone has their own opinions  But weighing the pros and cons can usually help someone come to a decision  It actually depends on the reason  like defending territory people  protecting allies from invasion  defending human rights  and punishing wrongdoing  For those  you can t just sit there  Report Post Reply0War is only justified if it is intervening with a genocidal country  Take WW2 for instance  If the Allied powers hadn t gone to war with Germany  more than just 6 million people would ve died  The total death count would ve been more like 10 million  if you also include the gypsies  Catholics  gay people  Jehovah s Witnesses and other groups that the Nazi s considered inferior  So tell me  all the people out there who believe war is not justified  how is  say  causing the deaths of over 10 million innocent people  an even more gargantuan number if the Holocaust never ended and Germany took over all of Europe  by not going to war better than causing the deaths of about 40 million soldiers to prevent innocent bloodshed at the hands of malicious dictators for years  So  I say once more  war is justified  Report Post Reply0War can be justified for reasons such as Self defense   last resort and protection of humanitarians  For example when Japan bombed us first we had to strike back because one they where holding our soldiers hostage and mistreating them  and with Germany we had to save jewish people  and then they kept imperialising other countries so we asked them to stop but they didnt so brittian and france declared war when they invaded poland  Report Post Reply0What brought us out of the

music  American Idol LOS ANGELES  CA  Catholic Online    The 34 year old singer  who has just recently released an album entitled   Hope In Front of Me   was a truck driver  Gokey says his first wife encouraged him to pursue his first love  music  Just weeks before Gokey auditioned for   American Idol    Sophia died unexpectedly during a routine heart surgery  Answer the call to help persecuted Christians by going here   The 34 year old Christian singer shared how the unexpected death of his wife Sophia  a few weeks before his national television debut  rattled his beliefs to their very core   before it ultimately strengthened them   It caused me to question everything  because you re taught in church that  you know  God is this   he s a healer  he s a helper  he s a refuge    Gokey shared in a podcast   And then I go  and I pray and I believe God  and she s praying and I m praying that God would heal her  and that doesn t happen  And so  it called everything that I believed into question   Sophia s death did not immediately call his faith into question  recalling the moments of darkness that he said crept up during the healing process   You know  at the time  you re in a terrible  emotional state  and you re just wanting God to use it because all things work together for the good    Gokey said    But  then as you re kind of sitting and you re walking through it  and the questions come and the dark times come and you re by yourself  and you re not on a high moment  you re in a valley   You know  you re trying to figure out   Well if you re so good  why did you not do this or that  And how come I feel like you abandoned me in the moment I needed you   And so   that loss caused my faith to come into question   Gokey believes the   grace of God   that delivered him through the pain  Taking to the   American Idol   stage four short weeks after his wife s death  he captured hearts with his story and progressed through the bulk of the competition  finishing in third place  This month is Glory to Marriage   When we live in our own towns and cities  we have our own connect group  you know  whether it s through our church  our family   your world is that    he said    When I was taken from that and put on a world stage  my world became bigger  so my perception of my situation became smaller  and so at that moment  the loss didn t have such a  n  effect at that point  But it has its ebbs and flows   Remarried and has two small children  Gokey continues to honor the memory of his late wife through an organization called Sophia s Heart Foundation  a nonprofit he founded that serves the poor in both Nashville and Milwaukee     Help Give every Student and Teacher FREE resources for a world class Moral Catholic Education Copyright 2018   Distributed

system  Swipe to advance1   23Sympathetic Nervous System This part of your autonomic system is in charge of your body s   fight or flight   response  When you come across a threat  your sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear  quickly changing body processes like your breathing and heart rate so that you have extra energy and are ready to face the danger or run away  Swipe to advance1   23Parasympathetic Nervous System The other part of your autonomic system has the opposite effect  It s the brake pedal to the sympathetic nervous system s gas pedal  It takes over with the   rest and digest   response to bring you back to normal after the danger has passed  Swipe to advance1   23Don t Drain Your Brain Stress that doesn t let up leaves your sympathetic nervous system on alert  And over time  that can lead to you losing your mental sharpness  You may take longer to react to things and make more errors   High levels of stress also affect your physical health  including weakening your immune system and raising your chance of heart disease  Swipe to advance1   23Neurons They re how your brain and body   talk   to each other  These nerve cells use special parts to communicate  The axon releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter that s picked up by the dendrite of another neuron  where it s turned into an electrical signal  Sensory neurons respond to things like sound  smell  and touch and deliver the info to your brain  Motor neurons bring messages from your brain to your muscles  Swipe to advance1   23Glial Cells These cells get their name from the Greek word for   glue    They surround  support  and cushion the neurons in your brain and spinal cord  But that s not all they do  Researchers are only beginning to understand the role glial cells play in how the brain works  neurological diseases  and more  Swipe to advance1   23Brain This incredibly complex and vital organ is made up of 100 billion or so neurons  It controls your movement  speech  heartbeat  and breathing  And it s the root of all your thoughts and feelings  Around the size of two clenched fists and weighing in at about 3 pounds  it s protected by your skull and the fluid it floats in  Swipe to advance1   23Cerebrum The largest part of the brain is divided into two halves called hemispheres  The left one  which controls the right side of your body  handles speech  logic  math calculations  and pulling facts from your memory  too  The right hemisphere  which controls your left side  is also in charge of music  recognizing faces  and understanding your body s position relative to what s around you  what s known as spatial awareness  Swipe to advance1   23Cortex The outermost layer of the cerebrum has many wrinkles and folds  This is where you ll find your brain s   gray matter    which processes information  Swipe to advance1   23Basal Ganglia You ll find this network of circuits deep inside the hemispheres of your brain  The basal ganglia coordinate movement  behavior  and emotions  They make things that happen in sequence possible  like walking and dancing  learning patterns  forming habits  and stopping activities then starting new ones  Damaged basal ganglia cause Parkinson s and Huntington s diseases  Swipe to advance1   23Cerebellum Your cerebellum oversees complicated movements  posture  and balance  It coordinates different muscle groups and fine tunes movements with practice  like hitting a golf ball or hockey puck  Because of it  walking can be a smooth  continuous motion  It s also important for language and speech  Swipe to advance1   23Amygdala This almond shaped area is responsible for your emotions and some behavior  It s believed your amygdala helps you do everything from form memories to pick up on social cues  It sounds the alarm that triggers your body s   fight or flight   response to danger  Swipe to advance1   23Hippocampus You have one on each side near the center of your brain  They help you learn and remember important who  what  and where details    like your boss s name and the location of your house    and turn short term memories into long term ones  It s one of the first areas damaged by Alzheimer s disease  Swipe to advance1   23Thalamus The top part of your brain stem is kind of like a post office for your senses  It gets signals related to sight  smell  hearing  taste  and touch and passes the information to other parts of your brain  Swipe to advance1   23Pons This key relay station is the middle part of your brain stem and a bridge between the cerebrum and the cerebellum  It s the origin of nerves that control facial expressions  eye movement  chewing and swallowing  and bladder control  It plays a role in breathing  And it s probably where your dreams happen  Swipe to advance1   23Medulla Oblongata Your medulla handles the autonomic things you don t think about  like your breathing  blood pressure  and heart rate  It s found at the bottom of the brain stem  where it helps transfer signals between the brain and spinal cord  too  Swipe to advance1   23Spinal Cord It s probably smaller than you think  about 17 inches long  the diagonal of a large laptop screen  and less than 1 2 inch wide  thinner than an adult s finger  It runs from the base of your brain down your back  surrounded by bones called vertebrae  Bundles of nerve fibers  protected by tissue and fluid  carry information back and forth from your brain to your body  Swipe to advance1   23Peripheral Nerves If the central nervous system is the main office  the peripheral nervous system is the workers out in the field  There are 12 cranial nerves that connect to the brain  including ones that let you smell  see  smile  and swallow  Another 31 pairs of nerve roots  one sensory  one motor  branch out from your spinal cord between the vertebrae  The sciatic nerve is the largest single nerve  It goes from your pelvis down the back of your thigh  Swipe to advance1   23Enteric Nervous System When someone talks about your   second brain    this is what they re referring to  It s a separate network of more than 100 million nerve cells that line your gastrointestinal tract and control the process of digestion  like moving stuff into your stomach  and out at the end   breaking down food  and absorbing nutrients  Swipe to advance1   23Diseases and Conditions Infections  injuries  poisons  even high blood sugar can harm parts of your nervous system  Stroke  meningitis  polio  migraine  carpal tunnel syndrome  epilepsy  MS  and shingles are all nervous system disorders  Doctors who treat them are called neurologists  Swipe to advance1   23Healthy Habits Taking care of yourself in general will also help your nervous system  Get plenty of sleep  Don t smoke  Find ways to relax  Exercise has

D1957003	 	Welcome to Reddit  Come for the cats  stay for the empathy  Become a Redditorand start exploring  This is an archived post  You won t be able to vote or comment 33New owner trying to dock pay 15 minutes if late by 1 minute  Ontario     self legaladvice submitted 2 years ago by legalthrower1Hello I am posting here because I am concerned about a new policy being implemented by the new owner of a retail store I work at  As the title says if we are 60 seconds late for our shift or from our breaks our pay is apparently being docked 15 minutes  We do have the privilege of paid 15 minute breaks at my store  so I can see where the logic is in this   but  there has been no formal policy statement and I have some concerns about how this will be implemented  I am not sure if this counts as a deduction of our wage  From what I understand  the store needs signed consent to do this  However  as I said before the fact we get paid breaks may negate this  Not entirely sure  The other concern I have is this   we are not always able to take our breaks due to the time of year and how busy things are  In addition  instead of department managers doing timesheets the responsibility of this has now been shifted to one person for the entire store s timesheets  I feel like one person keeping track of appropriate and legal deductions from employee wages is not realistic  Because there has been no written statement regarding this policy change I would like to meet with the store manager to address some of my concerns  I would also like to maybe write a letter and hand it out to my coworkers because lots of people are confused about this  Can punitive action be taken against me if I pursue this course of action Thank you very much for your time   I appreciate any advice you may be able to give and apologize if any part of my post is not appropriate for this subreddit 14 comments share save hide reportall 14 commentssorted by  best Want to add to the discussion Post a comment Create an account     Municipalis 42 points 2 years ago  I am not sure if this counts as a deduction of our wage It is a deduction  and it is illegal  If you show up one minute late  you are now working fourteen minutes for free  The breaks issue is separate  There is no requirement that the store give you a paid 15 minute break  unless it is written into your employment agreement  or you are not allowed to leave the workplace during the break    In fact  the only break requirement is that after 5 hours of work you have a 30 minute  unpaid break  So  if you were late  the manager would probably be allowed to to say that you forfeited your 15 minute paid break for the shift  The other concern I have is this   we are not always able to take our breaks due to the time of year and how busy things are  You are legally entitled to a 30 minute unpaid break after working for 5 hours  However  the employer may also provide shorter breaks  provided the total within the 5 hour period adds up to no less than 30 minutes  You must be completely free of work during this period  and allowed to leave the premises  I would also like to maybe write a letter and hand it out to my coworkers because lots of people are confused about this  Can punitive action be taken against me if I pursue this course of action An employer may not take any disciplinary action against you for asking him her to comply with the Employment Standards Act  2000  That said  as a first step I strongly recommend you give a call to the Ministry of Labour  They will provide you with information regarding your rights  including interpretations of the ESA on a no names basis GTA  416 326 7160 Canada wide  1 800 531 5551Edit  Crossed out the section just because it s irrelevant to the issue  Spacing for readability permalink embed save     Weyland The Dwarf 2 points 2 years ago So  if you were late  the manager would probably be allowed to to say that you forfeited your 15 minute paid break for the shift  If this is the case  could the employer say you forfeited his paid 15 minute break and allow him to take a non paid 15 minute break instead permalink embed save parent     Municipalis 3 points 2 years ago I can t think of any reason why not  unless the paid break was promised in the employment contract  That unpaid break would also count toward the 30 minute requirement  But I think the mechanics are important  If you are working  you must get paid  even if you are late  The employer s proper recourse to tardiness is discipline  not wage docking  It s entirely distinct from whether someone is getting a paid break or not  That has to be made clear because otherwise the employer might end up illegally docking wages if the late employee has to skip their break for whatever reason permalink embed save parent     legalthrower1    S  3 points 2 years ago Thank you for your detailed response  I will call the ministry of labour tomorrow  I believe  u Weyland The Dwarf is on the mark with their train of thought but I ve heard way too many conflicting words on how this is going to be implemented and it seems like a nightmare to keep track of for a department manager   much less for one person doing payroll for an entire retail storepermalink embed save parent     Valalvax 2 points 2 years ago Are you sure about that  It obviously could be a

and her parents from making treatment decisions  when the patient chose to discontinue a second round of chemotherapy after it made her   extremely ill    An appeals court ruled that the state s duty to protect the child s well being outweighed the parents  beliefs and convictions  and an attorney who was also a nurse  was given limited guardianship of the child    7  As a result of the hospital s actions  the patient s family went into hiding to avoid having their daughter   kidnapped      8  The girl s father told the Associated Press that the family does not oppose modern medicine nor did they make their decision based on religious beliefs    9  In 2014  the court appointed guardian was allowed to stop her efforts to force the family to resume chemotherapy  the guardian stated that she didn t have access to the child  making it impossible for her to make medical decisions    10  In October 2015  the court formally ended the guardianship    11 Affiliations and programs    edit The

D1010196	 	David Hume on Popular Religions David Hume on Popular Religions Enter subhead content here My Own Lifeby David  Hume1776It is difficult for a man to speak long of himself withoutvanity  therefore I shall be short  It may be thought an instanceof vanity that I pretend at all to write my life  but thisnarrative shall contain little more than the history of mywritings  as  indeed  almost all my life has been spent inliterary pursuits and occupations  The first success of most ofmy writing was not such as to be an object of vanity  I was born the  twenty sixth of April  1711  old style  at Edinburgh   I was of a good family  both by father and mother  myfather s family is a branch of the Earl of Home s  or Hume s  andmy ancestors had been proprietors of the estate which my brotherpossesses  for several generations  My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer  President of the College of Justice  the title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother  My family  however   was not rich  and being myself a youngerbrother   my patrimony  according to the mode of my country  wasof course very slender  My father  who passed for a man of parts died when I was an infant  leaving me  with an elder brother anda sister  under the care of our mother  a woman of singularmerit  who  though young and handsome  devoted herself entirelyto the rearing and educating of her children  I passed throughthe ordinary course of education with success  and was seizedvery early with a passion for literature  which has been theruling passion of my life  and the great source of my enjoyments  My studious disposition  my sobriety  and my industry  gave myfamily a notion that the law was a proper profession for me  but I found an insurmountable aversion to every thing but thepursuits of philosophy and general learning  and while theyfancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinius  Cicero and Virgil werethe authors which I was secretly devouring  My very slender  fortune  however  being unsuitable to thisplan  of life  and my health being a little broken by my ardentapplication  I was tempted  or rather forced  to make a veryfeeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life  In1734  I went to Bristol  with some recommendations to severaleminent merchants  but in a few months found that scene totallyunsuitable to me  I went over to France  with a view ofprosecuting my studies in a country retreat  and I there laidthat plan of life which I have steadily and successfully pursued  I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency offortune  to maintain unimpaired my independency  and to regardevery object as contemptible  except the improvements of mytalents in literature  During my retreat in France  first  at Rheims  but chiefly at La Flèche   in Anjou  I composed my Treatise of Human Nature  After passing three years very agreeably in that country  I cameover to London in 1737  In the end of 1738  I published my Treatise  and immediately went down to my mother and my brother who lived at his country house  and was employing himself veryjudiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune  Never literary  attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatiseof Human Nature  It fell dead born from the press  withoutreaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among thezealots  But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper  Ivery soon recovered the blow  and prosecuted with great ardor mystudies in the country  In 1742  I printed at Edinburgh  thefirst part of my Essays  The work was favorably received  andsoon made me entirely forget my former disappointment  Icontinued with my mother and brother in the country  and in thattime recovered the knowledge of the Greek language  which I hadtoo much neglected in my early youth  In 1745  I received  a letter from the Marquis of Annandale inviting  me to come and live with him in England  I found alsothat the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirousof putting him under my care and direction  for the state of hismind and health required it  I lived with him a twelve month  Myappointments during that time made a considerable accession to mysmall fortune  I then received an invitation from General St  Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition  which wasat first meant against Canada  but ended in an incursion on thecoast of France  Next year  to wit  1747  I received aninvitation from the general to attend him in the same station inis military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin  I thenwore the uniform of an officer  and was introduced at thesecourts as aid de camp to the general  along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant  now General Grant  These two yearswere almost the only interruptions which my studies have receivedduring the course of my life  I passed them agreeably  and ingood company  and my appointments  with my frugality  had made mereach a fortune which I called independent  though most of myfriends were inclined to smile when I said so  in short  I wasnow master of near a thousand pounds  I had always entertained a notion that my want of success inpublishing the Treatise of Human Nature had proceeded more fromthe manner than the matter  and that I had been guilty of a veryusual indiscretion in going to the press too early  I  therefore cast the first part of that work anew in the Inquiry concerning Human Understanding  which was published while I was at Turin  But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature  On my return from Italy  I had themortification to find all England in a ferment on account of Dr  Middleton s Free Inquiry  while my performance was entirelyoverlooked and neglected  A new edition  which had been publishedat London  of my Essays  Moral and Political  met not with a muchbetter reception  Such is the force of natural temper   that thesedisappointments made little  or no impression on me  I went down in  1749  and lived two years with my brother at his countryhouse  for my mother was now dead  I there composed the secondpart of my Essays which I called Political Discourses  and alsomy Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals  which is anotherpart of my Treatise that I cast anew  Meanwhile  my bookseller A  Millar  informed me  that my former publications  all but theunfortunate Treatise  were beginning to be the subject ofconversation  that the sale of them was gradually increasing  andthat new editions were demanded  Answers by reverends and rightreverends came out two or three in a year  and I found  by Dr  Warburton s railing  that the books were beginning to be esteemedin good company  However  I had fixed a resolution  which Iinflexibly maintained  never to reply to any body  and not beingvery irascible in my temper  I have easily kept myself clear ofall literary squabbles  These symptoms of a rising reputationgave me encouragement  as I was ever more disposed to see thefavorable than unfavorable side of things  a turn of mind whichit is more happy to possess  than to be born to an estate of tenthousand a year  In 1751  I removed from the country  to the town  the truescene for a man  of letters  In 1752 were published at Edinburgh where I then lived  my Political Discourses  the only work ofmine that was successful on the first publication  It was wellreceived at home and abroad  In the same year was published  at London  my Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals  which  inmy own opinion  who ought not to judge on that subject  is  ofall my writings  historical  philosophical  or literary incomparably the best  It came unnoticed and unobserved into theworld  In 1752  the Faculty of Advocates chose me their librarian an office from which I received little or no emolument  but whichgave me the command of a large library  I then formed the plan ofwriting the History of England  but being frightened with thenotion of continuing a narrative through a period of seventeenhundred years  I commenced with the accession of the house of Stuart  an epoch when  I thought  the misrepresentations offaction began chiefly to take place  I was  I own  sanguine in myexpectations of the success of this work  I thought that I wasthe only historian that had at once neglected present power interest and authority  and the cry of popular prejudices  and asthe subject was suited to every capacity  I expected proportionalapplause  But miserable was my disappointment  I was assailed byone cry of reproach  disapprobation  and even detestation English  Scotch  and irish  whig and tory  churchman and sectary freethinker and religionist  patriot and courtier  united intheir rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generoustear for the fate of Charles I and the Earl of Strafford  andafter the first ebullitions of their fury were over  what wasstill more mortifying  the book seemed to sink into oblivion  Mr  Millar told me that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty fivecopies of it  I scarcely  indeed  heard of one man in the threekingdoms  considerable for rank or letters  that could endure thebook  I must only except the primate of England  Dr  Herring  andthe primate of Ireland  Dr  Stone  which seem two odd exceptions  These dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to bediscouraged  I was  however  I confess  discouraged   and had not the warbeen at that time  breaking out between France and England  I hadcertainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom have changed my name  and never more have returned to my nativecountry  But as this scheme was not now practicable  and thesubsequent volume was considerably advanced  I resolved to pickup courage and to persevere  In this interval  I published   at London  my Natural Historyof Religion   along with some other small pieces  Its public entrywas rather obscure  except only that Dr  Hurd wrote a pamphletagainst it  with all the illiberal petulance  arrogance  andscurrility  which distinguish the Warburtonian school  Thispamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferentreception of my performance  In  1756  two years after the fall of the first volume  waspublished the second volume of my History  containing the periodfrom the death of Charles I till the revolution  This performancehappened to give less displeasure to the whigs  and was betterreceived  It not only rose itself  but helped to buoy up itsunfortunate brother  But though I had been taught by  experience that the whigparty were  in possession of bestowing all places  both in thestate and in literature  I was so little inclined to yield totheir senseless clamor  that in above a hundred alterations which further study  reading  or reflection engaged me to make inthe reigns of the two first Stuarts  I have made all of theminvariably to the tory side  It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan ofliberty  In 1759  I published my History of the House of Tudor  Theclamor against this performance was almost equal to that againstthe history of the two first Stuarts  The reign of Elizabeth wasparticularly obnoxious  But I was now callous against theimpressions of public folly  and continued very peaceably andcontentedly  in my retreat at Edinburgh  to finish  in twovolumes  the more early part of the English History which I gaveto the public in 1761  with tolerable  and but tolerable success  But  notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons   towhich my writings had been exposed   they had still been makingsuch advances   that the copy money given me by the booksellersmuch exceeded anything formerly known in England  I was becomenot only independent  but opulent  I retired to my native countryof Scotland  determined never more to set my foot out of it  andretailing the satisfaction of never having preferred a request toone great man  or even making advances of friendship to any ofthem  As I was now turned of fifty  I thought of passing all therest of my life in this philosophical manner  when I received  in1763  an invitation from the Earl of Hertford  with whom I wasnot in the least acquainted  to attend him on his embassy to Paris  with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to theembassy  and  in the meanwhile  of performing the functions ofthat office  This offer  however inviting  I at first declined both because I was reluctant to begin connections with the great and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humor  but on his lordship s repeating the invitation  I accepted of it  I have every reason  both of pleasure and interest  to thinkmyself happy in my connections with that nobleman  as well asafterwards with his brother  General Conway  Those who have  not seen the strange effects of modes  willnever imagine the reception I met with at Paris  from men andwomen of all ranks and stations  The more I resiled from theirexcessive civilities  the more I was loaded with them  There is however  a real satisfaction in living at Paris  from the greatnumber of sensible  knowing  and polite company with which thatcity abounds above all places in the universe  I thought once  of settling there for life  I was appointedsecretary to the embassy  and  in summer  1765  Lord Hertfordleft me  being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  I was chargéd affaires till the arrival of the duke of Richmond  towards theend of the year  In the beginning of 1766  I left Paris  and nextsummer went to Edinburgh  with the same view as formerly  ofburying myself in a philosophical retreat  I returned to thatplace  not richer  but with much more money  and a much largerincome  by means of Lord Hertford s friendship  than I left it and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce  as Ihad formerly made an experiment of a competency  But in 1767  Ireceived from Mr  Conway an invitation to be undersecretary  andthis invitation  both the character of the person  and myconnections with Lord Hertford  prevented me from declining  Ireturned to Edinburgh in 1769  very opulent  for I possessed arevenue of one thousand pounds a year   healthy  and thoughsomewhat stricken in years  with the prospect of enjoying long myease  and of seeing the increase of my reputation  In spring  1775   I was struck with a disorder in my bowels which  at first gave me no alarm  but has since  as I apprehendit  become mortal and incurable  I now reckon upon a speedydissolution  I have suffered very little pain from my disorder and what is more strange  have  notwithstanding the great declineof my person  never suffered a moment s abatement of my spirits insomuch  that were I to name a period of my life which I shouldmost choose to pass over again  I might be tempted to point tothis later period  I possess the same ardor as ever in study  andthe same gayety in company  I consider  besides  that a man ofsixty five  by dying  cuts off only a few years of infirmities and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation sbreaking out at last with additional luster  I know that I couldhave but few years to enjoy it  It is difficult to be moredetached from life than I am at present  To conclude  historically with my own character  I am  orrather was  for that is the style I must now use in speaking ofmyself  which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments   Iwas  I say  a man of mild disposition  of command of temper  ofan open  social  and cheerful humor  capable of attachment  butlittle susceptible of enmity  and of great moderation in all mypassions  Even my love of literary fame  my ruling passion  neversoured my temper  notwithstanding my frequent disappointments  Mycompany was not unacceptable to the young and careless  as wellas to the studious and literary  and as I took a particularpleasure in the company of modest women  I had no reason to bedispleased with the reception I met with from them  In a word though most men  anywise eminent  have found reason to complainof calumny  I never was touched  or even attacked  by her balefultooth  and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of bothcivil and religious factions  they seemed to be disarmed in mybehalf of their wonted fury  My friends never had occasion tovindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct  notbut that the zealots  we may well suppose  would have been gladto invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage  but theycould never find any which they thought would wear the face ofprobability  I cannot say there is no vanity in making thisfuneral oration of myself  but I hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared andascertained  APRIL 18  1776  I came across a  portion of letter by Boswell in a book on by the British jurnalist Ludovic Kenndy All in the Mind  A Farewell to God  Hu me not wishing to meet the fate of Voltaire chose to have  the chronicler  John Boswell  attend  The Catholic priest who attended the death  of Voltaire wrote that Voltaire recanted his opposition to Catholicism and received last rites  But the church doubted him did not believe their own priest for shortly after his issuing this statement  of Voltaire s last moments  it was requested by the people of Paris that their beloved Voltaire be buried in church  grounds  The church refused  This philosophical approach to death was not what the pious thought proper or expected  the reflections  at this time of those dying being concentrated on what awaited them in the great beyond  and trusting that their lives had  been an adequate preparation for it  Dr  Johnson  when he heard of Hume s calm at the approach of death  refused to  believe it  A few years earlier  when discussing with him the question of death  Boswell mentioned that Hume had told him  that he was no more uneasy to think that he should not be after this life than that he had not been before it   to which the orthodox Johnson replied   Sir  if he really thinks so  his perceptions are disturbed  he is mad  If he  does not think so  he lies   Such was the wisdom of the times  Friends came to say goodbye  including Boswell  For all his philanderings he was as much a conventional  believer as Johnson  and he left a wonderful and much quoted account of his last visit to the Great Infidel  On Sunday forenoon the 7th of July 1776  being too late for church  I went to see Mr  David Hume   who was returned from London and Bath  just a dying  I found him alone  in a reclining posture in his drawing room  He was  lean  ghastly and quite of an earthly appearance  He was dressed in a suit of grey cloth with white metal buttons and a kind  of scratch wig  He was quite different from the plump figure he used to present  He seemed to be placid and even cheerful   He said he was just approaching to his end  I think these were his words  I had a strong curiosity to be satisfied if he persisted in disbelieving a future  state even when he had death before his eyes  I asked him if it was not possible that there might be a future state  He answered  it was possible that a piece of coal put upon the fire would not burn  and he added that it was a most unreasonable fancy  that we should exist for ever  That immortality  if it were at all  must be general  that a great proportion of the human  race has hardly any intellectual qualities  that a great proportion dies in infancy before being possessed of reason  yet  all these must be immortal  that a porter who gets drunk with gin by ten o clock must be immortal  that the trash of  every age must be preserved  and that new universes must be created to contain such numbers  This appeared to me an unphilosophical  objection  and I said  Mr  Hume  you know spirit does not take up space        I asked him if the thought of annihilation never gave him any uneasiness  He said  not the least   Well   said I   Mr  Hume  I hope to triumph  over you when I meet you in a future state  and remember you are not to pretend that you was joking with all this infidelity    No  no   said he   But I shall have been so long there before you come that it will be nothing new   In  this style of humour and levity did I conduct the conversation  Perhaps it was wrong on so awful a subject  But as nobody was present  I thought  it could have no bad effect  I however felt a degree of horror  mixed with a sort of wild  strange  hurrying recollection  of my excellent mother s pious instructions  of Dr Johnson s noble lessons  and of my religious sentiments and  affections during the course of my life  I was like a man in sudden danger eagerly seeking his defensive arms  and I could  not but be assailed by momentary doubts while I had actually before me a man of such strong abilities and extensive inquiry  dying in the persuasion of being annihilated  When Boswell reported to Johnson that Hume was quite easy at the thought of annihilation  the doctor   who was terrified of death  confirmed what he had said earlier   He lied  He had a vanity in being thought easy   It is more probable he lied than that so very improbable a thing should be as a man not afraid of death    On the day of Hume s burial  Boswell went along to inspect the open grave  and hid behind a  wall to watch the mourners pass  fearful that the grave might be desecrated by religious zealots  That it was not desecrated  was due  at least in part  to the presence of two guards whom the family had hired to watch it  Even then there was no ending to the controversy over Hume s
